<#
This sample code shows how to automate the creation of the Entra ID app required for Set-OutlookSignatures.

Both types of apps are supported: The one for end users, and the one for SimulateAndDeploy.

You can adapt it to fit your environment.
The sample code is written in a generic way, which allows for easy adaption.
