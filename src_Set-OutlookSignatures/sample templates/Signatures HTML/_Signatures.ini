# This file defines which templates are to be used, which mailboxes receive a specific template, and which additional settings shall be applied
# See the 'Signature and OOF template file format' chapter at https://set-outlooksignatures.com/details for more details and enhanced usage examples


# Do not modify this file directly, but a copy of it.
# Place the copy in a separate folder structure recommended in the README FAQ 'What is the recommended folder structure for script, license, template and config files?'
# and use the 'SignatureIniFile' parameter (also described in the README file).


# Comments can start with '#' or ';' or '//'
	; Whitespace(s) at the beginning and the end of a line are ignored
// Empty lines are ignored


# Step 1: Put file names with extensions in square brackets
#   Example 1: [Company external English formal.htm]
#   Example 2: [Company external English formal.htm]
#   Putting file names in single or double quotes is possible, but not necessary
#   File names are case insensitive
#     [file a.htm] is the same as ["File A.htm"] and ['fILE a.htm']
#   When there are two or more sections for a filename, the keys and values are not combined. Each section is considered individually (SortCulture and SortOrder still apply).
#   File names not mentioned in this file are not considered, even if they are available in the file system.
#   Only the following file extensions are supported:
#     When the 'UseHtmTemplates' script parameter is set to 'false' (default): .docx
#     When the 'UseHtmTemplates' script parameter is set to 'true': .htm
#
# Step 2: Add tags in the lines below the filename
#   Example 1 (signature):
#     user.a@example.com
#     defaultNew
#     defaultReplyFwd
#   Example 2 (OOF):
#     defaultInternal
#     defaultExternal
#   Only one tag per line is allowed
#   Adding not a single tag to file name section is valid.
#     The signature template is then classified as a common template.
#   Putting file names in single or double quotes is possible, but not necessary
#   Tags are case insensitive
#     defaultNew is the same as "DefaultNew" and 'dEFAULTnEW'
#   You can override the automatic Outlook signature name generation by setting OutlookSignatureName
#     With this option, you can have different template file names for the same Outlook signature name
#     This only makes sense for signatures, see the sample signature INI files for examples
#     Take care of signature group priorities (common, group, email address) and SortOrder parameter
#     Invalid characters for Outlook signature names: \/:"*?><,|@ plus the ones returned by [System.Io.Path]::GetInvalidFileNameChars()
#   For more possible tags, see the README file.
#
# Step 3: Make the software use this INI file by passing the 'SignatureIniFile' or 'OOFIniFile' parameter


# Which group naming format should I choose?
#   - When using the '<DNS or NetBIOS name of AD domain> <…>' format, use the SamAccountName whenever possible.
#     The combination of domain name and SamAccountName is unique, while a display name may exist multiple times in a domain.
#   - When using the 'EntraID <…>' format, prefer Object ID and securityIdentifier whenever possible.
#     Object ID and securityIdentifier are always unique, email address and mailNickname can wrongly exist on multiple objects, and the uniqueness of displayName is in your hands.
#   - 'EntraID' and 'AzureAD' always refer to the home tenant of the logged-in user.
#     To address a specific tenant use 'EntraID_<tenant ID>' or 'EntraID_<tenant domain>'.
#     See 'GraphClientID' at https://set-outlooksignatures.com/parameters for details about cross-tenant and multitenant support.
#
# When should I refer on-prem groups and when Entra ID groups?
#   - When using the '-GraphOnly true' parameter, prefer Entra ID groups ('EntraID <…>').
#     You may also use on-prem groups ('<DNS or NetBIOS name of AD domain> <…>') as long as they are synchronized to Entra ID.
#   - In hybrid environments without using the '-GraphOnly true' parameter, prefer on-prem groups ('<DNS or NetBIOS name of AD domain> <…>') synchronized to Entra ID.
#     Pure entra ID groups ('EntraID <…>') only make sense when all mailboxes covered by Set-OutlookSignatures are hosted in Exchange Online.
#   - Pure on-prem environments: You can only use on-prem groups ('<DNS or NetBIOS name of AD domain> <…>').
#     When moving to a hybrid environment, you do not need to adapt the configuration as long as you synchronize your on-prem groups to Entra ID.


# Consider using the 'VirtualMailboxConfigFile' parameter to add virtual mailboxes and dynamically create signature and out-of-office INI lines through code.
#   A sample scenario: Dynamically assign signatures for delegated mailboxes (such as for vacation replacements) by
#     1. Get the permissions regularly through Export-RecipientPermissions (https://github.com/GruberMarkus/Export-RecipientPermissions)
#     2. Use 'VirtualMailboxConfigFile' to read these permissions and to assign signatures even if a user does not add the mailbox to Outlook.


[<Set-OutlookSignatures configuration>]
# This is a special section, using an identifier that is not valid as a file name.

# SortOrder
#   Define the application order of templates within each template group (common, group specific, mailbox specific, replacement variabe specific)
#   The templates are applied from the first to the last entry of the sorted list
#   Default: AsInThisFile
#   Possible values: Ascending, asc, up, Descending, desc, down, AsInThisFile
SortOrder = AsInThisFile

# SortCulture
#   Define the culture used to sort the file list
#   Default: 127 (invariant)
#   Possible values: Get-Culture -ListAvailable
SortCulture = 127
