If email signatures or out-of-office replies are on your agenda, the following is worth reading - whether you work in marketing, sales, corporate communications, the legal or the compliance department, as Exchange or client administrator, as CIO or IT lead, as key user or consultant.

Email signatures and out-of-office replies are an integral part of corporate identity and corporate design, of successful concepts for media and internet presence, and of marketing campaigns. Similar to web presences, business emails are usually subject to an imprint obligation, and non-compliance can result in severe penalties.

Central management and deployment ensures that design guidelines are met, guarantees correct and up-to-date content, helps comply with legal requirements, relieves staff and creates an additional marketing and sales channel.

**You can do all this, and more, with Set-OutlookSignatures and the Benefactor Circle add-on.**

# Overview and features&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#feature-comparison"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/go%20to-🆚%20Feature%20Comparison%20🆚-lawngreen?labelColor=black" alt="Go to feature comparison"></a><!-- omit in toc -->

With Set-OutlookSignatures, signatures and out-of-office replies can be:
- Generated from **templates in DOCX or HTML** file format  
- Customized with a **broad range of variables**, including **photos**, from Active Directory and other sources
  - Variables are available for the **currently logged-on user, this user's manager, each mailbox and each mailbox's manager**
  - Images in signatures can be **bound to the existence of certain variables** (useful for optional social network icons, for example)
- Designed for **barrier-free accessibility** with custom link and image descriptions for screen readers and comparable tools
- Applied to all **mailboxes (including shared mailboxes¹)**, specific **mailbox groups**, specific **email addresses** (including alias and secondary addresses), or specific **user or mailbox properties**, for **every mailbox across all Outlook profiles (Outlook, New Outlook¹, Outlook Web¹)**, including **automapped and additional mailboxes¹**  
- Created with different names from the same template, **one template can be used for many mailboxes**
- Assigned **time ranges** within which they are valid¹  
- Set as **default signature** for new emails, or for replies and forwards (signatures only)  
- Set as **default OOF message** for internal or external recipients (OOF messages only)  
- Set in **Outlook Web¹** for the currently logged-in user, including mirroring signatures to the cloud as **roaming signatures¹** (Linux/macOS/Windows, Classic and New Outlook¹)  
- Centrally managed only¹, or **exist along user-created signatures** (signatures only)  
- Automatically added to new emails, reply emails and appointments with the **Outlook add-in**¹  
- Copied to an **additional path¹** for easy access to signatures on mobile devices or for use with email clients and apps besides Outlook: Apple Mail, Google Gmail, Samsung Mail, Mozilla Thunderbird, GNOME Evolution, KDE KMail, and others.
- Create an **email draft containing all available signatures** in HTML and plain text for easy access in mail clients that do not have a signatures API
- **Write protected** (Outlook for Windows signatures only)

Set-OutlookSignatures can be **run by users on Windows, Linux and macOS clients, including shared devices and terminal servers - or on a central system with a service account¹**.  
On clients, it can run as part of the logon script, as scheduled task, or on user demand via a desktop icon, start menu entry, shortcut or any other way of starting a program - **whatever your operating system and software deployment mechanism allows**.  
Signatures and OOF messages can also be created and pushed into mailboxes centrally, **without end user or client involvement¹**.

**Sample templates** for signatures and OOF messages demonstrate many features and are provided as .docx and .htm files.

**Simulation mode** allows content creators and admins to simulate the behavior of the software for a specific user at a specific point in time, and to inspect the resulting signature files before going live.

**SimulateAndDeploy¹** allows to deploy signatures to Outlook Web¹/New Outlook¹ (when based on Outlook Web) without any client deployment or end user interaction, making it ideal for users that only log on to web services but never to a client (users with a Microsoft 365 F-license, for example).

The software is **designed to work in big and complex environments** (Exchange resource forest scenarios, across AD trusts, multi-level AD subdomains, many objects). It works **on premises, in hybrid and in cloud-only environments**.  
All **national clouds are supported**: Public (AzurePublic), US Government L4 (AzureUSGovernment), US Government L5 (AzureUSGovernment DoD), China (AzureChinaCloud operated by 21Vianet).

It is **multi-client capable** by using different template paths, configuration files and script parameters.

Set-OutlookSignatures requires **no installation on servers or clients**. You only need a standard SMB file share on a central system, and optionally Office on your clients.  
There is also **no telemetry** or "calling home", emails are **not routed through a 3rd party data center or cloud service**, and there is **no need to change DNS records (MX, SPF) or email flow**.

A **documented implementation approach**, based on real life experiences implementing the software in multi-client environments with a five-digit number of mailboxes, contains proven procedures and recommendations for product managers, architects, operations managers, account managers and email and client administrators.  
The implementation approach is **suited for service providers as well as for clients**, and covers several general overview topics, administration, support, training across the whole lifecycle from counselling to tests, pilot operation and rollout up to daily business.

The software core is **Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS)**. It is published under a license which is approved, among others, by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and the Open Source Initiative (OSI), and is compatible with the General Public License (GPL) and other popular licenses. Please see `.\LICENSE.txt` for copyright and license details.

Footnote 1 (¹): **Some features are exclusive to the Benefactor Circle add-on.**
ExplicIT Consulting's commercial Benefactor Circle add-on enhances Set-OutlookSignatures with additional features and fee-based support, ensuring that the core of Set-OutlookSignatures can remain Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) and continues to evolve. See <a href="./Benefactor%20Circle.md" target="_blank">'.\docs\Benefactor Circle'</a> for details.

# 1. Requirements  
You need Exchange Online or Exchange on-prem.

Set-OutlookSignatures can run in two modes:
- In the security context of the currently logged-in user. This is recommended for most scenarios.
- On a central system, using a service account to push signatures into users mailboxes. This can be useful for accounts that only log on to the email service, but not to a client (such as M365 F-licenses). See 'SimulateAndDeploy' in this document for details.

A Linux, macOS or Windows system with PowerShell:
- Windows: Windows PowerShell 5.1 ('powershell.exe', part of Windows) or PowerShell 7+ ('pwsh.exe')
- Linux, macOS: PowerShell 7+ ('pwsh')

On Windows, Outlook and Word are typically used, but not required in all constellations:
- When Outlook 2010 or higher is installed and has profiles configured, Outlook is used as source for mailboxes to deploy signatures for.  
  - If Outlook is not installed or configured, New Outlook is used if available.
  - If New Outlook is configured as default application in Outlook, New Outlook is used.
  - In any other cases, Outlook Web is used as source for mailboxes.
- Word 2010 or higher is required when templates in DOCX format are used, or when RTF signatures need to be created.

Signature templates can be in DOCX (Windows) or HTML format (Windows, Linux, macOS). Set-OutlookSignatures comes with sample templates in both formats.

The software must run in PowerShell Full Language mode. Constrained Language mode is not supported, as some features such as BASE64 conversions are not available in this mode or require very slow workarounds.

On Windows and macOS, unblock the file 'Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1'. You can use the PowerShell cmdlet 'Unblock-File' for this, or right-click the file in File Explorer, select Properties and check 'Unblock'. This removes the "mark of the web", which can prevent script execution when the PowerShell execution policy is set to RemoteSigned.

If you use AppLocker or a comparable solution (Defender, CrowdStrike, Ivanti, and others), you may need to add the existing digital file signature to your allow list, or define additional settings in your security software.

**Thanks to our partnership with [ExplicIT Consulting](https://explicitconsulting.at), Set-OutlookSignatures and its components are digitally signed with an Extended Validation (EV) Code Signing Certificate (which is the highest code signing standard available).  
This is not only available for Benefactor Circle members, but also the Free and Open Source core version is code signed.**

The paths to the template and configuration files (SignatureTemplatePath, OOFTemplatePath, GraphConfigFile, etc.) must be accessible by the currently logged-in user. The files must be at least readable for the currently logged-in user.

In cloud environments, you need to register Set-OutlookSignatures as Entra ID app and provide admin consent for the required permissions. See the Quick Start Guide or '.\config\default graph config.ps1' for details.

Make sure that Set-OutlookSignatures is not executed more than once in the same PowerShell session. If possible, Set-OutlookSignatures should always be executed in a new PowerShell session. In addition to productive use, this applies in particular to tests, as this is the only way to prevent problems caused by .Net caching DLL files in memory.
## 1.1. Linux and macOS<!-- omit in toc -->
Not all features are yet available on Linux and macOS. Every parameter contains appropriate information, which can be summarized as follows:

**Common restrictions and notes for Linux and macOS**
- Only mailboxes hosted in Exchange Online are supported. On-prem mailboxes usually work when addressed via Exchange Online, but this is not guaranteed.
- Only Graph is supported, no local Active Directories.<br>The parameter `GraphOnly` is automatically set to `true` and Linux and macOS, which requires an Entra ID app - the Quick Start Guide in this document helps you implement this.
- Signature and OOF templates must be in HTM format.<br>Microsoft Word is not available on Linux, and the file format conversion cannot be done without user impact on macOS.<br>If you do not want to manually convert your DOCX files to HTM, remove incompatible and superfluous code and restore images to their original resolution: Our partner [ExplicIT Consulting](https://explicitconsulting.at) offers a commercial batch conversion service.<br>The parameter `UseHtmTemplates` is automatically set to `true` on Linux and macOS.
- Only existing mount points and SharePoint Online paths can be accessed.<br>Set-OutlookSignatures cannot create mount points itself, as there are just too many possibilities.<br>This is important for all parameters pointing to folders or files (`SignatureTemplatePath`, `SignatureIniFile`, `OOFTemplatePath`, `OOFIniFile`, `AdditionalSignaturePath`, `ReplacementVariableConfigFile`, `GraphConfigFile`, etc.). The default values for these parameters are automatically set correctly, so that you can follow the Quick Start Guide without additional configuration. When hosting `GraphConfigFile` on SharePoint Online make sure you also define the `GraphClientID` parameter.<br><br>If SharePoint Online is not an option for you, consider one of the following options for production use:
  - Deploy a software package that not only contains Set-OutlookSignatures, but also all required template and configuration files.
  -	Place Set-OutlookSignatures, the templates and its configuration as ZIP file in a public place (such as your website), and use Intune with a remediation script to download and extract the ZIP file (this might not need your security requirements).
  - Change your execution script or task, so that all required paths are mounted before Set-OutlookSignatures is run.

**Linux specific restrictions and notes**
- Users need to access their mailboxes via Outlook Web, as no other form of Outlook is available on Linux (use emulation tools such as Wine, CrossOver, PlayOnLinux, Proton, etc. at your own risk).
  - Support for Outlook Web requires the Benefactor Circle add-on. See <a href="./Benefactor%20Circle.md" target="_blank">'.\docs\Benefactor Circle'</a> for details.
- When using email clients such as Mozilla Thunderbird, GNOME Evolution, KDE KMail or others, you can still use signatures created by Set-OutlookSignatures with the Benefactor Circle add-on, as they are stored in the folder `$([IO.Path]::Combine([environment]::GetFolderPath('MyDocuments'), 'Outlook Signatures'))` per default (parameter `AdditionalSignaturePath`).

**macOS specific restrictions and notes**
- Classic Outlook for Mac is supported
  - Until Classic Outlook supports roaming signatures (which is very likely to never happen), it is treated like Outlook for Windows configured not to use roaming signatures. Consider using the '-MailboxSpecificSignatureNames' parameter.
- New Outlook for Mac is supported
  - Until New Outlook supports roaming signatures (not yet announced by Microsoft), it is treated like Outlook for Windows configured not to use roaming signatures. Consider using the '-MailboxSpecificSignatureNames' parameter.
  - If New Outlook is enabled, an alternate method of account detection is used, as scripting is not yet supported by Microsoft, but already announced on the M365 roadmap. This alternate method may detect accounts that are no longer used in Outlook (see software output for details).  
  - If the alternate method does not find accounts, Outlook Web is used and existing signatures are synchronized with New Outlook for Mac.
    - Support for Outlook Web requires the Benefactor Circle add-on. See <a href="./Benefactor%20Circle.md" target="_blank">'.\docs\Benefactor Circle'</a> for details.
- Classic Outlook for Mac and New Outlook for Mac do not allow external software to set default signatures.
- When using email clients such as Apple Mail or others, you can still use signatures created by Set-OutlookSignatures with the Benefactor Circle add-on, as they are stored in the folder `$([IO.Path]::Combine([environment]::GetFolderPath('MyDocuments'), 'Outlook Signatures'))` per default (parameter `AdditionalSignaturePath`).

# 2. Quick Start Guide
Deploy your first signatures in less than an hour!

1. For a first test run, it is recommended to log on with a test user on a Windows system with Word and Outlook installed, and Outlook being configured with at least the test user's mailbox. This way, you get results fast and can experience the biggest set of features.
   - For full Linux and macOS support, the Benefactor Circle add-on (see <a href="./Benefactor%20Circle.md" target="_blank">'.\docs\Benefactor Circle'</a> and is required and the mailboxes need to be hosted in Exchange Online.
2. Download Set-OutlookSignatures and extract the archive to a local folder
   - On Windows and macOS, unblock the file 'Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1'. You can use the PowerShell cmdlet 'Unblock-File' for this, or right-click the file in File Explorer, select Properties and check 'Unblock'. This removes the "mark of the web", which can prevent script execution when the PowerShell execution policy is set to RemoteSigned.
3. If you use AppLocker or a comparable solution (Defender, CrowdStrike, Ivanti, and others), you may need to add the existing digital file signature to your allow list, or define additional settings in your security software.
4. Now it is time to run Set-OutlookSignatures for the first time
   - **If _all mailboxes_ are in Exchange _on-prem only_ and the logged-in user has access to the on-prem Active Directory:**<br>Just run 'Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1' in PowerShell.<br>For best results, don't run the software by double clicking it in File Explorer, or via right-click and 'Run'. Instead, run the following command:
   
      ```batch
      powershell.exe -noexit -file "c:\test\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1"
      ```

   - **If _some or all mailboxes_ are in Exchange _Online_:**
     1. You need to register an Entra ID app first, because Set-OutlookSignatures needs permissions to access the Graph API.
          - To create the Entra ID app, run '`.\sample code\Create-EntraApp.ps1 -AppType 'Set-OutlookSignatures' -AppName 'Set-OutlookSignatures'`' and follow the instructions. You will need an Entra ID user with 'Global Admin' or 'Application Administrator' permissions.
          - See '`.\config\default graph config.ps1`' for details about the required application settings, permissions, and why they are needed.
     2. Run Set-OutlookSignatures
        - **If _all mailboxes_ are in Exchange _Online_, or you are in a hybrid environment _without_ synchronizing all required Exchange attributes to on-prem** (mail, legacyExchangeDN, msExchRecipientTypeDetails, msExchMailboxGuid, proxyAddresses):

          ```batch
          powershell.exe -noexit -file "c:\test\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1" -GraphOnly true -GraphClientId "<GraphClientId from step 1>"
          ```

          Always choose this option if you are in **hybrid mode and directly create new mailboxes in Exchange Online**, as at least the required attribute msExchMailboxGuid is not synchronized to on-prem in this case. See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/exchange/troubleshoot/move-mailboxes/migrationpermanentexception-when-moving-mailboxes for details and two possible workarounds.

          The '`-GraphOnly true`' parameter makes sure that on-prem Active Directory is ignored and only Graph/Entra ID is used to find mailboxes and their attributes.
        - **If _all mailboxes_ are in a hybrid environment _with_ synchronizing all required Exchange attributes to on-prem** (mail, legacyExchangeDN, msExchRecipientTypeDetails, msExchMailboxGuid, proxyAddresses):

          ```batch
          powershell.exe -noexit -file "c:\test\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1" -GraphClientId "<GraphClientID from step 1>"
          ```

          This runs Set-OutlookSignatures with default parameters, preferring on-prem Active Directory to find mailboxes and their attributes, and only using Graph/Entra ID when neccessary.
        - If you are not using the public Microsoft Cloud, add the parameter '`-CloudEnvironment [AzureUSGovernment|AzureUSGovernmentDoD|AzureChina]`' parameter.
<p></p>
Set-OutlookSignatures now runs using default settings and sample templates.<br>Because of the '`-noexit`' parameter, the window hosting Set-OutlookSignatures will not close after the software completed. This is helpful for debugging and learning.<br><br>

Next, check the script output for errors, displayed in red in the PowerShell console.
- If there are no errors, switch to Outlook and have a look at the newly created signatures, especially to the showcase signature named '`Test all default replacement variables`'.
- If there is an error:
  1. Read the message carefully as it may contain hints on how to resolve the issue.  
  2. Check if the README file contains a hint.
  3. Check if someone has already reported the problem as and issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Set-OutlookSignatures/Set-OutlookSignatures/issues?q=is%3Aissue), and create a new one if you can't find any hint on how to solve it.

When everything runs fine with default settings, it is time to start customizing the software behavior to your needs:
- Create a folder with your own template files and signature configuration file.
  - Start with DOCX templates. See '`Should I use .docx or .htm as file format for templates?`' in this document for details.
  - See the following chapters in this document for instructions:
    - Signature and OOF file format
    - Signature template file naming
    - Template tags and INI files
  - Make sure to pass the parameters '`SignatureTemplatePath`', '`SignatureIniFile`', '`OOFTemplatePath`' and '`OOFIniFile`' to Set-OutlookSignatures.
- Adapt other parameters you may find useful, or start experimenting with simulation mode.<br>The feature list and the parameter documentation show what's possible.<br><br>

It is strongly recommended to not change any Set-OutlookSignatures files and keep them as they are. If you consequently work with script parameters and keep customized configuration files in a separate folder, upgrading to a new version is basically just a file copy operation (drop-in replacement).

Regarding configuration files: Besides the template configuration files for signatures and OOF messages, there are the Graph configuration file and the replacement variable configuration file.  
It is rarely needed to change the configuration within these files.<br>The configuration files themselves contain specific information on how to use them.<br>The configuration files are referenced in the documentation whenever there is a need or option to change them.

You also have access to '`.\docs\Implementation approach`', a document covering the organizational aspects of introducing Set-OutlookSignatures.
The content is based on real life experiences implementing the software in multi-client environments with a five-digit number of mailboxes.  
It contains proven procedures and recommendations for product managers, architects, operations managers, account managers and email and client administrators. It is suited for service providers as well as for clients.  
It covers several general overview topics, administration, support, training across the whole lifecycle from counselling to tests, pilot operation and rollout up to daily business.

## 3.1. SignatureTemplatePath<!-- omit in toc -->
The parameter SignatureTemplatePath tells the software where signature template files are stored.

Local and remote paths are supported. Local paths can be absolute (`C:\Signature templates`) or relative to the software path (`.\templates\Signatures`).

SharePoint document libraries are supported (https only): `https://server.domain/sites/SignatureSite/SignatureDocLib/SignatureFolder` or `\\server.domain@SSL\sites\SignatureSite\SignatureDocLib\SignatureFolder`

Parameters and SharePoint sharing hints ('/:u:/r', etc.) are removed: 'https://YourTenant.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/SomeSite/SomeLibrary/SomeFolder/SomeFile.ini?SomeParam1=1&SomeParam2=2' -> 'https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/SomeSite/SomeLibrary/SomeFolder/SomeFile.ini'

On Linux and macOS, only already existing mount points and SharePoint Online paths can be accessed. Set-OutlookSignatures cannot create mount points itself, and access to SharePoint on-prem paths is a Windows-only feature.

For access to SharePoint Online, the Entra ID app needs the Files.Read.All or Files.SelectedOperations.Selected permission, and you need to pass the 'GraphClientID' parameter to Set-OutlookSignatures.

Default value: '.\sample templates\Signatures DOCX' on Windows, '.\sample templates\Signatures HTML' on Linux and macOS

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -SignatureTemplatePath '.\sample templates\Signatures DOCX'  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -SignatureTemplatePath '.\sample templates\Signatures DOCX'"

## 3.2. SignatureIniFile<!-- omit in toc -->
Template tags are placed in an INI file.

The file must be UTF-8 encoded (without BOM).

See '.\templates\Signatures DOCX\_Signatures.ini' for a sample file with further explanations.

Local and remote paths are supported. Local paths can be absolute ('C:\Signature templates') or relative to the software path ('.\templates\Signatures')

SharePoint document libraries are supported (https only): 'https://server.domain/sites/SignatureSite/SignatureDocLib/SignatureFolder' or '\\server.domain@SSL\sites\SignatureSite\SignatureDocLib\SignatureFolder'

Parameters and SharePoint sharing hints ('/:u:/r', etc.) are removed: 'https://YourTenant.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/SomeSite/SomeLibrary/SomeFolder/SomeFile.ini?SomeParam1=1&SomeParam2=2' -> 'https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/SomeSite/SomeLibrary/SomeFolder/SomeFile.ini'

On Linux and macOS, only already existing mount points and SharePoint Online paths can be accessed. Set-OutlookSignatures cannot create mount points itself, and access to SharePoint on-prem paths is a Windows-only feature.

For access to SharePoint Online, the Entra ID app needs the Files.Read.All or Files.SelectedOperations.Selected permission, and you need to pass the 'GraphClientID' parameter to Set-OutlookSignatures.

Default value: '.\templates\Signatures DOCX\_Signatures.ini' on Windows, '.\templates\Signatures HTML\_Signatures.ini' on Linux and macOS

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -SignatureIniFile '.\templates\Signatures DOCX\_Signatures.ini'  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -SignatureIniFile '.\templates\Signatures DOCX\_Signatures.ini'"

## 3.3. ReplacementVariableConfigFile<!-- omit in toc -->
The parameter ReplacementVariableConfigFile tells the software where the file defining replacement variables is located.

The file must be UTF-8 encoded (without BOM).

Local and remote paths are supported. Local paths can be absolute (`C:\config\default replacement variables.ps1`) or relative to the software path (`.\config\default replacement variables.ps1`).

SharePoint document libraries are supported (https only): `https://server.domain/SignatureSite/config/default replacement variables.ps1` or `\\server.domain@SSL\SignatureSite\config\default replacement variables.ps1`

Parameters and SharePoint sharing hints ('/:u:/r', etc.) are removed: 'https://YourTenant.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/SomeSite/SomeLibrary/SomeFolder/SomeFile.ini?SomeParam1=1&SomeParam2=2' -> 'https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/SomeSite/SomeLibrary/SomeFolder/SomeFile.ini'

On Linux and macOS, only already existing mount points and SharePoint Online paths can be accessed. Set-OutlookSignatures cannot create mount points itself, and access to SharePoint on-prem paths is a Windows-only feature.

For access to SharePoint Online, the Entra ID app needs the Files.Read.All or Files.SelectedOperations.Selected permission, and you need to pass the 'GraphClientID' parameter to Set-OutlookSignatures.

Default value: `.\config\default replacement variables.ps1`  

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -ReplacementVariableConfigFile '.\config\default replacement variables.ps1'  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -ReplacementVariableConfigFile '.\config\default replacement variables.ps1'"

## 3.4. GraphClientID<!-- omit in toc -->
ID of the Entra ID app to use for Graph authentication.

This parameter must be used when the parameter GraphConfigFile points to a SharePoint Online location.

Per default, GraphClientID is not overwritten by the configuration defined in GraphConfigFile, but you can change this in the Graph config file itself.

Default value: $null

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 GraphClientID '3dc5f201-6c36-4b94-98ca-c66156a686a8'
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 GraphClientID '3dc5f201-6c36-4b94-98ca-c66156a686a8'"

## 3.5. GraphConfigFile<!-- omit in toc -->
The parameter GraphConfigFile tells the software where the file defining Graph connection and configuration options is located.

The file must be UTF-8 encoded (without BOM).

Local and remote paths are supported. Local paths can be absolute (`C:\config\default graph config.ps1`) or relative to the software path (`.\config\default graph config.ps1`).

SharePoint document libraries are supported (https only): `https://server.domain/SignatureSite/config/default graph config.ps1` or `\\server.domain@SSL\SignatureSite\config\default graph config.ps1`

Parameters and SharePoint sharing hints ('/:u:/r', etc.) are removed: 'https://YourTenant.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/SomeSite/SomeLibrary/SomeFolder/SomeFile.ini?SomeParam1=1&SomeParam2=2' -> 'https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/SomeSite/SomeLibrary/SomeFolder/SomeFile.ini'

When GraphConfigFile is hosted on SharePoint Online, it is highly recommended to set the `GraphClientID` parameter. Else, access to GraphConfigFile will fail on Linux and macOS, and fall back to WebDAV with a required Internet Explorer authentication cookie on Windows.

On Linux and macOS, only already existing mount points and SharePoint Online paths can be accessed. Set-OutlookSignatures cannot create mount points itself, and access to SharePoint on-prem paths is a Windows-only feature.

For access to SharePoint Online, the Entra ID app needs the Files.Read.All or Files.SelectedOperations.Selected permission, and you need to pass the 'GraphClientID' parameter to Set-OutlookSignatures.

Default value: `.\config\default graph config.ps1`  

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -GraphConfigFile '.\config\default graph config.ps1'  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 GraphConfigFile '.\config\default graph config.ps1'"

## 3.6. TrustsToCheckForGroups<!-- omit in toc -->
List of domains to check for group membership.

If the first entry in the list is '*', all outgoing and bidirectional trusts in the current user's forest are considered.

If a string starts with a minus or dash ('-domain-a.local'), the domain after the dash or minus is removed from the list (no wildcards allowed).

All domains belonging to the Active Directory forest of the currently logged-in user are always considered, but specific domains can be removed (`*', '-childA1.childA.user.forest`).

When a cross-forest trust is detected by the '*' option, all domains belonging to the trusted forest are considered but specific domains can be removed (`*', '-childX.trusted.forest`).

On Linux and macOS, this parameter is ignored because on-prem Active Directories are not supported (only Graph is supported).

Default value: '*'

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -TrustsToCheckForGroups 'corp.example.com', 'corp.example.net'  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -TrustsToCheckForGroups 'corp.example.com', 'corp.example.net'"

## 3.7. IncludeMailboxForestDomainLocalGroups<!-- omit in toc -->
Shall the software consider group membership in domain local groups in the mailbox's AD forest?

Per default, membership in domain local groups in the mailbox's forest is not considered as the required LDAP queries are slow and domain local groups are usually not used in Exchange.

Domain local groups across trusts behave differently, they are always considered as soon as the trusted domain/forest is included in TrustsToCheckForGroups.

On Linux and macOS, this parameter is ignored because on-prem Active Directories are not supported (only Graph is supported).

Allowed values: 1, 'true', '$true', 'yes', 0, 'false', '$false', 'no'

Default value: $false

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -IncludeMailboxForestDomainLocalGroups $false  
Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -IncludeMailboxForestDomainLocalGroups false  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -IncludeMailboxForestDomainLocalGroups $false"  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -IncludeMailboxForestDomainLocalGroups false"

## 3.8. DeleteUserCreatedSignatures<!-- omit in toc -->  
Shall the software delete signatures which were created by the user itself?

This feature requires a Benefactor Circle license.

Allowed values: 1, 'true', '$true', 'yes', 0, 'false', '$false', 'no'

Default value: $false

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -DeleteUserCreatedSignatures $false  
Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -DeleteUserCreatedSignatures false  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -DeleteUserCreatedSignatures $false"  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -DeleteUserCreatedSignatures false"

## 3.9. DeleteScriptCreatedSignaturesWithoutTemplate<!-- omit in toc -->
Shall the software delete signatures which were created by the software before but are no longer available as template?

This feature requires a Benefactor Circle license.

Allowed values: 1, 'true', '$true', 'yes', 0, 'false', '$false', 'no'

Default value: $true

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -DeleteScriptCreatedSignaturesWithoutTemplate $false  
Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -DeleteScriptCreatedSignaturesWithoutTemplate false  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -DeleteScriptCreatedSignaturesWithoutTemplate $false"  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -DeleteScriptCreatedSignaturesWithoutTemplate false"

## 3.10. SetCurrentUserOutlookWebSignature<!-- omit in toc -->
Shall the software set the Outlook Web signature of the currently logged-in user?

If the parameter is set to `$true` and the current user's mailbox is not configured in any Outlook profile, the current user's mailbox is considered nevertheless. If no Outlook mailboxes are configured at all, additional mailbox configured in Outlook Web are used. This way, the software can be used in environments where only Outlook Web is used. 

This feature requires a Benefactor Circle license.

Allowed values: 1, 'true', '$true', 'yes', 0, 'false', '$false', 'no'

Default value: $true  

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -SetCurrentUserOutlookWebSignature $true  
Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -SetCurrentUserOutlookWebSignature true  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -SetCurrentUserOutlookWebSignature $true"  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -SetCurrentUserOutlookWebSignature true"

## 3.11. SetCurrentUserOOFMessage<!-- omit in toc -->
Shall the software set the out-of-office (OOF) message of the currently logged-in user?

If the parameter is set to `$true` and the current user's mailbox is not configured in any Outlook profile, the current user's mailbox is considered nevertheless. If no Outlook mailboxes are configured at all, additional mailbox configured in Outlook Web are used. This way, the software can be used in environments where only Outlook Web is used. 

This feature requires a Benefactor Circle license.

Allowed values: 1, 'true', '$true', 'yes', 0, 'false', '$false', 'no'

Default value: $true  

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -SetCurrentUserOOFMessage $true  
Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -SetCurrentUserOOFMessage true  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -SetCurrentUserOOFMessage $true"  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -SetCurrentUserOOFMessage true"

## 3.12. OOFTemplatePath<!-- omit in toc -->
Path to centrally managed out-of-office templates.

Local and remote paths are supported.

Local paths can be absolute (`C:\OOF templates`) or relative to the software path (`.\templates\ Out-of-office `).

SharePoint document libraries are supported (https only): `https://server.domain/SignatureSite/OOFTemplates` or `\\server.domain@SSL\SignatureSite\OOFTemplates`

Parameters and SharePoint sharing hints ('/:u:/r', etc.) are removed: 'https://YourTenant.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/SomeSite/SomeLibrary/SomeFolder/SomeFile.ini?SomeParam1=1&SomeParam2=2' -> 'https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/SomeSite/SomeLibrary/SomeFolder/SomeFile.ini'

On Linux and macOS, only already existing mount points and SharePoint Online paths can be accessed. Set-OutlookSignatures cannot create mount points itself, and access to SharePoint on-prem paths is a Windows-only feature.

For access to SharePoint Online, the Entra ID app needs the Files.Read.All or Files.SelectedOperations.Selected permission, and you need to pass the 'GraphClientID' parameter to Set-OutlookSignatures.

Default value: '.\templates\Signatures DOCX\_Signatures.ini' on Windows, '.\templates\Signatures DOCX\_Signatures.ini' on Linux and macOS

Default value: `.\templates\Out-of-Office DOCX` on Windows, `.\templates\Out-of-Office DOCX` on Linux and macOS

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -OOFTemplatePath '.\templates\Out-of-Office DOCX'  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -OOFTemplatePath '.\templates\Out-of-Office DOCX'"

## 3.13. OOFIniFile<!-- omit in toc -->
Template tags are placed in an INI file.

The file must be UTF-8 encoded (without BOM).

See '`.\templates\Out-of-Office DOCX\_OOF.ini`' for a sample file with further explanations.

Local and remote paths are supported. Local paths can be absolute ('C:\Signature templates') or relative to the software path ('.\templates\Signatures')

SharePoint document libraries are supported (https only): 'https://server.domain/sites/SignatureSite/SignatureDocLib/SignatureFolder' or '\\server.domain@SSL\sites\SignatureSite\SignatureDocLib\SignatureFolder'

Parameters and SharePoint sharing hints ('/:u:/r', etc.) are removed: 'https://YourTenant.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/SomeSite/SomeLibrary/SomeFolder/SomeFile.ini?SomeParam1=1&SomeParam2=2' -> 'https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/SomeSite/SomeLibrary/SomeFolder/SomeFile.ini'

On Linux and macOS, only already existing mount points and SharePoint Online paths can be accessed. Set-OutlookSignatures cannot create mount points itself, and access to SharePoint on-prem paths is a Windows-only feature.

For access to SharePoint Online, the Entra ID app needs the Files.Read.All or Files.SelectedOperations.Selected permission, and you need to pass the 'GraphClientID' parameter to Set-OutlookSignatures.

Default value: `.\templates\Out-of-Office DOCX\_OOF.ini` on Windows, Default value: `.\templates\Out-of-Office HTML\_OOF.ini` on Linux and macOS

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -OOFIniFile '.\templates\Out-of-Office DOCX\_OOF.ini'  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -OOFIniFile '.\templates\Out-of-Office DOCX\_OOF.ini'"

## 3.14. AdditionalSignaturePath<!-- omit in toc -->
An additional path that the signatures shall be copied to.  
Ideally, this path is available on all devices of the user, for example via Microsoft OneDrive or Nextcloud.

This way, the user can easily copy-paste his preferred preconfigured signature for use in an email app not supported by this script, such as Microsoft Outlook Mobile, Apple Mail, Google Gmail or Samsung Email.

Local and remote paths are supported.

Local paths can be absolute (`C:\Outlook signatures`) or relative to the software path (`.\Outlook signatures`).

SharePoint document libraries are supported (https only, no SharePoint Online): `https://server.domain/User/Outlook signatures` or `\\server.domain@SSL\User\Outlook signatures`

Parameters and SharePoint sharing hints ('/:u:/r', etc.) are removed: 'https://YourTenant.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/SomeSite/SomeLibrary/SomeFolder/SomeFile.ini?SomeParam1=1&SomeParam2=2' -> 'https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/SomeSite/SomeLibrary/SomeFolder/SomeFile.ini'

The currently logged-in user needs at least write access to the path.

If the folder or folder structure does not exist, it is created.

On Linux and macOS, only already existing mount points and SharePoint Online paths can be accessed. Set-OutlookSignatures cannot create mount points itself, and access to SharePoint on-prem paths is a Windows-only feature.

For access to SharePoint Online, the Entra ID app needs the Files.Read.All or Files.SelectedOperations.Selected permission, and you need to pass the 'GraphClientID' parameter to Set-OutlookSignatures.

Also see related parameter 'EmbedImagesInHtmlAdditionalSignaturePath'.

This feature requires a Benefactor Circle license (when used outside of simulation mode).

Default value: `"$(try { $([IO.Path]::Combine([environment]::GetFolderPath('MyDocuments'), 'Outlook Signatures')) } catch {})"`  

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -AdditionalSignaturePath "$(try { $([IO.Path]::Combine([environment]::GetFolderPath('MyDocuments'), 'Outlook Signatures')) } catch {})"  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -AdditionalSignaturePath ""$(try { $([IO.Path]::Combine([environment]::GetFolderPath('MyDocuments'), 'Outlook Signatures')) } catch {})"""

## 3.15. UseHtmTemplates<!-- omit in toc -->
With this parameter, the software searches for templates with the extension .htm instead of .docx.

Templates in .htm format must be UTF-8 encoded (without BOM) and the charset must be set to UTF-8 (`<META content="text/html; charset=utf-8">`).

Each format has advantages and disadvantages, please see `Should I use .docx or .htm as file format for templates? Signatures in Outlook sometimes look different than my templates.` in this document for a quick overview.

Only images in the first subfolder below the template file matching the Windows Connected Files naming convention (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/shell/manage#connected-files) are downloaded. Only use relative paths for the src attribute in img tags. All other paths are considered external and are not downloaded.

Also see the documentation for the '`EmbedImagesInHtml`' parameter.

Allowed values: 1, 'true', '$true', 'yes', 0, 'false', '$false', 'no'

Default value: $false on Windows, $true on Linux and macOS

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -UseHtmTemplates $false  
Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -UseHtmTemplates false  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -UseHtmTemplates $false"  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -UseHtmTemplates false"

## 3.16. SimulateUser<!-- omit in toc -->
SimulateUser is a mandatory parameter for simulation mode. This value replaces the currently logged-in user.

Use a logon name in the format 'Domain\User' or a Universal Principal Name (UPN, looks like an email address, but is not necessarily one).

Default value: $null

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -SimulateUser "EXAMPLEDOMAIN\UserA"  
Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -SimulateUser "user.a@example.com"  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -SimulateUser ""EXAMPLEDOMAIN\UserA"""  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -SimulateUser ""user.a@example.com"""

## 3.17. SimulateMailboxes<!-- omit in toc -->
SimulateMailboxes is optional for simulation mode, although highly recommended.

It is a comma separated list of email addresses replacing the list of mailboxes otherwise gathered from the simulated user's Outlook Web.

Default value: $null

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -SimulateMailboxes 'user.b@example.com', 'user.b@example.net'  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -SimulateMailboxes 'user.a@example.com', 'user.b@example.net'"

## 3.18. SimulateTime<!-- omit in toc -->
SimulateTime is optional for simulation mode.

Use a certain timestamp for simulation mode. This allows you to simulate time-based templates.

Format: yyyyMMddHHmm (yyyy = year, MM = two-digit month, dd = two-digit day, HH = two-digit hour (0..24), mm = two-digit minute), local time

Default value: $null

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -SimulateTime "202312311859"  
Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -SimulateUser "202312311859"  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -SimulateUser ""202312311859"""  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -SimulateUser ""202312311859"""

## 3.19. SimulateAndDeploy<!-- omit in toc -->
Not only simulate, but also deploy signatures to Outlook Web/New Outlook (when based on New Outlook).

Makes only sense in combination with '.\sample code\SimulateAndDeploy.ps1', do not use this parameter for other scenarios

See '.\sample code\SimulateAndDeploy.ps1' for an example how to use this parameter

Allowed values: 1, 'true', '$true', 'yes', 0, 'false', '$false', 'no'

Default value: $false

## 3.20. SimulateAndDeployGraphCredentialFile<!-- omit in toc -->
Path to file containing Graph credential which should be used as alternative to other token acquisition methods.

Makes only sense in combination with `.\sample code\SimulateAndDeploy.ps1`, do not use this parameter for other scenarios.

See `.\sample code\SimulateAndDeploy.ps1` for an example how to create and use this file.

Default value: $null

## 3.21. GraphOnly<!-- omit in toc -->
Try to connect to Microsoft Graph only, ignoring any local Active Directory.

The default behavior is to try Active Directory first and fall back to Graph. On Linux and macOS, only Graph is supported.

Allowed values: 1, 'true', '$true', 'yes', 0, 'false', '$false', 'no'

Default value: $false on Windows, $true on Linux and macOS

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -GraphOnly $false  
Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -GraphOnly false  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -GraphOnly $false"  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -GraphOnly false"

## 3.22. CloudEnvironment<!-- omit in toc -->
The cloud environment to connect to.

Allowed values:
- 'Public' (or: 'Global', 'AzurePublic', 'AzureGlobal', 'AzureCloud', 'AzureUSGovernmentGCC', 'USGovernmentGCC')
- 'AzureUSGovernment' (or: 'AzureUSGovernmentGCCHigh', 'AzureUSGovernmentL4', 'USGovernmentGCCHigh', 'USGovernmentL4')
- 'AzureUSGovernmentDOD' (or: 'AzureUSGovernmentL5', 'USGovernmentDOD', 'USGovernmentL5')
- 'China' (or: 'AzureChina', 'ChinaCloud', 'AzureChinaCloud')

Default value: 'Public'

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -CloudEnvironment "Public"  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -CloudEnvironment ""Public"""  

## 3.23. CreateRtfSignatures<!-- omit in toc -->
Should signatures be created in RTF format?

Allowed values: 1, 'true', '$true', 'yes', 0, 'false', '$false', 'no'

Default value: $false

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -CreateRtfSignatures $false  
Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -CreateRtfSignatures false  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -CreateRtfSignatures $false"  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -CreateRtfSignatures false"

## 3.24. CreateTxtSignatures<!-- omit in toc -->
Should signatures be created in TXT format?

Allowed values: 1, 'true', '$true', 'yes', 0, 'false', '$false', 'no'

Default value: $true

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -CreateTxtSignatures $true  
Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -CreateTxtSignatures true  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -CreateTxtSignatures $true"  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -CreateTxtSignatures true"

## 3.25. MoveCSSInline<!-- omit in toc -->
Move CSS to inline style attributes, for maximum email client compatibility.

This parameter is enabled per default, as a workaround to Microsoft's problem with formatting in Outlook Web (M365 roaming signatures and font sizes, especially).

Allowed values: 1, 'true', '$true', 'yes', 0, 'false', '$false', 'no'

Default value: $true

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -MoveCSSInline $true  
Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -MoveCSSInline true  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -MoveCSSInline $true"  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -MoveCSSInline true"

## 3.26. EmbedImagesInHtml<!-- omit in toc -->
Should images be embedded into HTML files?

When using HTML templates: Only images in the first subfolder below the template file matching the Windows Connected Files naming convention (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/shell/manage#connected-files) are supported. Only use relative paths for the src attribute in img tags. All other paths are considered external and are not embedded.

Outlook 2016 and newer can handle images embedded directly into an HTML file as BASE64 string (`<img src="data:image/[…]"`).

Outlook 2013 and earlier can't handle these embedded images when composing HTML emails (there is no problem receiving such emails, or when composing RTF or TXT emails).

When setting EmbedImagesInHtml to `$false`, consider setting the Outlook registry value "Send Pictures With Document" to 1 to ensure that images are sent to the recipient (see https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/inline-images-may-display-as-a-red-x-in-outlook-704ae8b5-b9b6-d784-2bdf-ffd96050dfd6 for details). Set-OutlookSignatures does this automatically for the currently logged-in user, but it may be overridden by other scripts or group policies.

Allowed values: 1, 'true', '$true', 'yes', 0, 'false', '$false', 'no'

Default value: $false

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -EmbedImagesInHtml $false  
Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -EmbedImagesInHtml false  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -EmbedImagesInHtml $false"  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -EmbedImagesInHtml false"

## 3.27. EmbedImagesInHtmlAdditionalSignaturePath<!-- omit in toc -->
Some feature as 'EmbedImagesInHtml' parameter, but only valid for the path defined in AdditionalSignaturesPath when not in simulation mode.

Allowed values: 1, 'true', '$true', 'yes', 0, 'false', '$false', 'no'

Default value: $true

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -EmbedImagesInHtmlAdditionalSignaturePath $true  
Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -EmbedImagesInHtmlAdditionalSignaturePath true  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -EmbedImagesInHtmlAdditionalSignaturePath $true"  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -EmbedImagesInHtmlAdditionalSignaturePath true"

## 3.28. DocxHighResImageConversion<!-- omit in toc -->
Enables or disables high resolution images in HTML signatures.

When enabled, this parameter uses a workaround to overcome a Word limitation that results in low resolution images when converting to HTML. The price for high resolution images in HTML signatures are more time needed for document conversion and signature files requiring more storage space.

Disabling this feature speeds up DOCX to HTML conversion, and HTML signatures require less storage space - at the cost of lower resolution images.

Contrary to conversion to HTML, conversion to RTF always results in high resolution images.

This feature requires a Benefactor Circle license.

Allowed values: 1, 'true', '$true', 'yes', 0, 'false', '$false', 'no'

Default value: $true

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -DocxHighResImageConversion $true  
Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -DocxHighResImageConversion true  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -DocxHighResImageConversion $true"  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -DocxHighResImageConversion true"

## 3.29. SignaturesForAutomappedAndAdditionalMailboxes<!-- omit in toc -->
Deploy signatures for automapped mailboxes and additional mailboxes.

Signatures can be deployed for these mailboxes, but not set as default signature due to technical restrictions in Outlook.

This feature requires a Benefactor Circle license.

Allowed values: 1, 'true', '$true', 'yes', 0, 'false', '$false', 'no'

Default value: $true

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -SignaturesForAutomappedAndAdditionalMailboxes $true  
Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -SignaturesForAutomappedAndAdditionalMailboxes true  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -SignaturesForAutomappedAndAdditionalMailboxes $true"  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -SignaturesForAutomappedAndAdditionalMailboxes true"

## 3.30. DisableRoamingSignatures<!-- omit in toc -->
Disable signature roaming in Classic Outlook for Windows. Has no effect on signature roaming via the MirrorCloudSignatures parameter.

A value representing true disables roaming signatures, a value representing false enables roaming signatures, any other value leaves the setting as-is.

Attention:
- When Outlook v16 and higher is allowed to sync signatures itself, it may overwrite signatures created by this software with their cloud versions. To avoid this, it is recommended to set the parameters DisableRoamingSignatures and MirrorCloudSignatures to true instead.
- When Classic Outlook for Windows syncs roaming signatures witht its own internal engine, expect problems with character encoding (umlauts, diacritics, emojis, etc.) and more. Until Microsoft provides a sustaining solution, these Outlook-internal problems will come and go depending on the patch level of Outlook. Also see FAQ '`Roaming signatures in Classic Outlook for Windows look different`' in this document.

Only sets HKCU registry key, does not override configuration set by group policy.

Allowed values: 1, 'true', '$true', 'yes', 0, 'false', '$false', 'no', $null, ''

Default value: $true

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -DisableRoamingSignatures $true  
Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -DisableRoamingSignatures true  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -DisableRoamingSignatures $true"  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -DisableRoamingSignatures true"

## 3.31. MirrorCloudSignatures<!-- omit in toc -->
Should local signatures be mirrored with signatures in Exchange Online?

Possible for Exchange Online mailboxes:
- Download for every mailbox where the current user has full access
- Upload and set default signaures for the mailbox of the current user

Prerequisites:
- Download
  - Current user has full access to the mailbox
  - When set to '`CurrentUserOnly`': Mailbox is the mailbox of the currently logged-in user and is hosted in Exchange Online
- Upload, set default signatures
  - Script parameter `SetCurrentUserOutlookWebSignature` is set to `true`
  - Mailbox is the mailbox of the currently logged-in user and is hosted in Exchange Online

Please note:
- As there is no Microsoft official API yet, this feature is to be used at your own risk.
- This feature does not work in simulation mode, because the user running the simulation does not have access to the signatures stored in another mailbox.
- For mailboxes in Exchange Online: To delete manually created signatures (signatures that have not been created by Set-OutlookSignatures) you need to use New Outlook for Windows or Classic Outlook for Windows with its own roaming signature sync mechanism enabled, or you delete the signature both locally and in Outlook Web.<br>Else, manually created signatures will be re-downloaded from the cloud or re-uploaded to the cloud because Set-OutlookSignatures technically cannot detect the deletion.
  - When a signature exists in only one of two places, and both places can neither be permanently monitored nor provide an activity log: Has the signature been deleted in the one place, or has it been created in the other? This question cannot be answered. To avoid data loss, Set-OutlookSignatures always assumes the signature has been created.

The process is very simple and straight forward. Set-OutlookSignatures goes through the following steps for each mailbox:
1. Check if all prerequisites are met
2. Download all signatures stored in the Exchange Online mailbox
  - This mimics Outlook's behavior: Roaming signatures are only manipulated in the cloud and then downloaded from there.
  - An existing local signature is only overwritten when the cloud signature is newer and when it has not been processed before for a mailbox with higher priority
3. Go through standard template and signature processing
  - Loop through the templates and their configuration, and convert them to signatures
  - Set default signatures for replies and forwards
  - If configured, delete signatures created by the user
  - If configured, delete signatures created earlier by Set-OutlookSignatures but now no longer have a corresponding central configuration
4. Delete all signatures in the cloud and upload all locally stored signatures to the user's personal mailbox as roaming signatures

There may be too many signatures available in the cloud - in this case, having too many signatures is better than missing some.

Another advantage of this solution is that it makes roaming signatures available in Outlook versions that do not officially support them.

What will not work:
- Download from mailboxes where the current user does not have full access rights. This is not possible because of Microsoft API restrictions.
- Download from and upload to shared mailboxes. This is not possible because of Microsoft API restrictions.
- Uploading signatures other than device specific signatures and such assigned to the mailbox of the current user. Uploading is not implemented, because until now no way could be found that does not massively impact the user experience as soon as the Outlook integrated download process starts (signatures available multiple times, etc.)

Attention: When Outlook v16 and higher is allowed to sync signatures itself, it may overwrite signatures created by this software with their cloud versions. To avoid this, it is recommended to set the parameters DisableRoamingSignatures and MirrorCloudSignatures to true instead. Also see FAQ '`Roaming signatures in Classic Outlook for Windows look different`' in this document.

Consider combining MirrorCloudSignatures with MailboxSpecificSignatureNames.

This feature requires a Benefactor Circle license.

Allowed values: 1, 'true', '$true', 'yes', 0, 'false', '$false', 'no', 'CurrentUserOnly'

Default value: $true

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -MirrorCloudSignatures $false  
Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -MirrorCloudSignatures false  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -MirrorCloudSignatures $false"  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -MirrorCloudSignatures false"

## 3.32. MailboxSpecificSignatureNames<!-- omit in toc -->
Should signature names be mailbox specific by adding the email address?

For compatibility with Outlook storing signatures in the file system, Set-OutlookSignatures converts templates to signatures according to the following logic:
1. Get all mailboxes and sort them: Mailbox of logged-on/simulated user, other mailboxes in default Outlook profile or Outlook Web, mailboxes from other Outlook profiles
2. Get all template files, sort them by category (common, group specific, mailbox specific, replacement variable specific), and within each category by SortOrder and SortCulture defined in the INI file
3. Loop through the mailbox list, and for each mailbox loop through the template list.
4. If a template's conditions apply and if the template has not been used before, convert the template to a signature.

The step 4 condition `if the template has not been used before` makes sure that a lower priority mailbox does not replace a signature with the same name which has already been created for a higher priority mailbox.

With roaming signatures (signatures being stored in the Exchange Online mailbox itself) being used more and more, the step 4 condition `if the template has not been used before` makes less sense. By setting the `MailboxSpecificSignatureNames` parameter to `true`, this restriction no longer applies. To avoid naming collisions, the email address of the current mailbox is added to the name of the signature - instead of a single `Signature A` file, Set-OutlookSignatures can create a separate signature file for each mailbox: `Signature A (user.a@example.com)`, `Signature A (mailbox.b@example.net)`, etc.

This naming convention intentionally matches Outlook's convention for naming roaming signatures. Before setting `MailboxSpecificSignatureNames` to `true`, consider the impact on the `DisableRoamingSignatures` and `MirrorCloudSignatures` parameters - it is recommended to set both parameters to `true` to achieve the best user experience and to avoid problems with Outlook's own roaming signature synchronisation.

Allowed values: 1, 'true', '$true', 'yes', 0, 'false', '$false', 'no'

Default value: $false

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -MailboxSpecificSignatureNames $false
Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -MailboxSpecificSignatureNames false
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -MailboxSpecificSignatureNames $false"
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -MailboxSpecificSignatureNames false"

## 3.33. WordProcessPriority<!-- omit in toc -->
Define the Word process priority. With lower values, Set-OutlookSignatures runs longer but minimizes possible performance impact

Allowed values (ascending priority): Idle, 64, BelowNormal, 16384, Normal, 32, AboveNormal, 32768, High, 128, RealTime, 256

Default value: 'Normal' ('32')

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -WordProcessPriority Normal  
Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -WordProcessPriority 32  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -WordProcessPriority Normal"  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -WordProcessPriority 32"

## 3.34. ScriptProcessPriority<!-- omit in toc -->
Define the script process priority. With lower values, Set-OutlookSignatures runs longer but minimizes possible performance impact

Allowed values (ascending priority): Idle, 64, BelowNormal, 16384, Normal, 32, AboveNormal, 32768, High, 128, RealTime, 256

Default value: 'Normal' ('32')

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -ScriptProcessPriority Normal  
Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -ScriptProcessPriority 32  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -ScriptProcessPriority Normal"  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -ScriptProcessPriority 32"

## 3.35. SignatureCollectionInDrafts<!-- omit in toc -->
When enabled, this creates and updates an email message with the subject 'My signatures, powered by Set-OutlookSignatures Benefactor Circle' in the drafts folder of the current user, containing all available signatures in HTML and plain text for easy access in mail clients that do not have a signatures API.

This feature requires a Benefactor Circle license.

Allowed values: 1, 'true', '$true', 'yes', 0, 'false', '$false', 'no'

Default value: $true

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -SignatureCollectionInDrafts $false
Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -SignatureCollectionInDrafts false
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -SignatureCollectionInDrafts $false"
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -SignatureCollectionInDrafts false"

## 3.36. BenefactorCircleID<!-- omit in toc -->
The Benefactor Circle member ID matching your license file, which unlocks exclusive features.

Default value: ''

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -BenefactorCircleID "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -BenefactorCircleID ""00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"""  

## 3.37. BenefactorCircleLicenseFile<!-- omit in toc -->
The Benefactor Circle license file matching your Benefactor Circle ID, which unlocks exclusive features.

Default value: ''

Local and remote paths are supported. Local paths can be absolute ('C:\Signature templates') or relative to the software path ('.\templates\Signatures')

SharePoint document libraries are supported (https only): 'https://server.domain/sites/SignatureSite/SignatureDocLib/SignatureFolder' or '\\server.domain@SSL\sites\SignatureSite\SignatureDocLib\SignatureFolder'

Parameters and SharePoint sharing hints ('/:u:/r', etc.) are removed: 'https://YourTenant.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/SomeSite/SomeLibrary/SomeFolder/SomeFile.ini?SomeParam1=1&SomeParam2=2' -> 'https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/SomeSite/SomeLibrary/SomeFolder/SomeFile.ini'

On Linux and macOS, only already existing mount points and SharePoint Online paths can be accessed. Set-OutlookSignatures cannot create mount points itself, and access to SharePoint on-prem paths is a Windows-only feature.

For access to SharePoint Online, the Entra ID app needs the Files.Read.All or Files.SelectedOperations.Selected permission, and you need to pass the 'GraphClientID' parameter to Set-OutlookSignatures.

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -BenefactorCircleLicenseFile ".\license.dll"  
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -BenefactorCircleLicenseFile "".\license.dll"""  

## 3.38. VirtualMailboxConfigFile<!-- omit in toc -->
Path a PowerShell file containing the logic to define virtual mailboxes. You can also use the VirtualMailboxConfigFile to dynamically define signature INI file and out-of-office INI entries.

Virtual mailboxes are mailboxes that are not available in Outlook but are treated by Set-OutlookSignatures as if they were.

This is an option for scenarios where you want to deploy signatures or out-of-office replies with not only the '`$CurrentUser...$`' but also '`$CurrentMailbox...$`' replacement variables for mailboxes that have not been added to Outlook, such as in Send As or Send On Behalf scenarios, where users often only change the from address but do not add the mailbox to Outlook.

See '`.\sample code\VirtualMailboxConfigFile.ps1`' for sample code showing the most relevant use cases.

For maximum automation, use VirtualMailboxConfigFile together with [Export-RecipientPermissions](https://github.com/Export-RecipientPermissions).

This feature requires a Benefactor Circle license.

Local and remote paths are supported. Local paths can be absolute ('C:\VirtualMailboxConfigFile.ps1') or relative to the software path ('.\sample code\VirtualMailboxConfigFile')

SharePoint document libraries are supported (https only): 'https://server.domain/SignatureSite/config/VirtualMailboxConfigFile.ps1' or '\\server.domain@SSL\SignatureSite\config\VirtualMailboxConfigFile.ps1'

Parameters and SharePoint sharing hints ('/:u:/r', etc.) are removed: 'https://YourTenant.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/SomeSite/SomeLibrary/SomeFolder/SomeFile.ini?SomeParam1=1&SomeParam2=2' -> 'https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/SomeSite/SomeLibrary/SomeFolder/SomeFile.ini'

On Linux and macOS, only already existing mount points and SharePoint Online paths can be accessed. Set-OutlookSignatures cannot create mount points itself, and access to SharePoint on-prem paths is a Windows-only feature.

For access to SharePoint Online, the Entra ID app needs the Files.Read.All or Files.SelectedOperations.Selected permission, and you need to pass the 'GraphClientID' parameter to Set-OutlookSignatures.

Default value: ''

Usage example PowerShell: & .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -VirtualMailboxConfigFile '.\sample code\VirtualMailboxConfigFile.ps1'
Usage example Non-PowerShell: powershell.exe -command "& .\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -VirtualMailboxConfigFile '.\sample code\VirtualMailboxConfigFile.ps1'"

# 4. The Outlook add-in
With a [Benefactor Circle](Benefactor%20Circle.md) license, you also have access to the Set-OutlookSignatures add-in for Outlook. This Outlook add-in can:
- Automatically add signatures when creating a new email or answering an email (including Outlook for Android and Outlook for iOS), also for alias and secondary email addresses
- Automatically add signatures to appointment invites, also for alias and secondary email addresses
- Allow to select signature in the taskpane of the Outlook add-in. This is like having roaming signatures on-prem.

The Outlook add-in is self-hosted by you. Compared to using a solution hosted by a 3rd party, this has several advantages:
- Client specific configuration
- You have full control over the version that is used
- Keeps license costs low
- Is the preferred method from a data protection and privacy perspective

The add-in code is downloaded by the Outlook client and executed locally, in the security context of the mailbox. There are no middleware or proxy servers involved. Data is only transferred between your Outlook client, your authentication system (Entra ID for Exchange Online) and your mailbox servers.

## 4.1. Usage<!-- omit in toc -->
From an end user perspective, basically nothing needs to be done or configured: When writing a new email, answering an email, or creating a new appointment, the add-in automatically adds the corresponding default signature.

For advanced usage and debug logging, a taskpane is available in all Outlook versions supporting this feature.

In compose mode, the taskpane allows to manually choose a signature, set the selected signature, and to temporarily override admin-defined settings for debug logging and Outlook host restrictions.

In message read mode, the taskpane cannot set signatures, of course. But it is very useful to check if the add-in is deployed correctly, and if it can access signatures. This is especially useful on mobile devices, in situations where enabling the debug mode is not wanted, and for basic tests when launch events are not triggered by Outlook.

The taskpane can be accessed through:
- Outlook Web (Exchange Online), New Outlook for Windows, New Outlook for Mac:
  - New mail, reply mail, read mail: "Message" tab, "Apps" icon
  - New appointment: Ribbon, "…" menu
- Outlook Web (on-prem):
  - New mail, reply mail: Lower right corner of the compose window
  - New appointment: At the right of the menu bar at the top of the compose window
  - Read mail: Left to the reply button
- Classic Outlook for Windows, Classic Outlook for Mac:
  - New mail, reply mail, read mail: "Message" tab, "All apps" icon
  - New appointment: "Appointment" or "Meeting" tab, "All apps" icon
- Outlook for iOS, Outlook for Android
  - These platforms do not support taskpanes for new mails, reply mails and appointments.
  - Read mail: Three dots ("…" or "⋮")in the email header

## 4.2. Requirements<!-- omit in toc -->
### 4.2.1. Outlook clients<!-- omit in toc -->
The Outlook add-in works for all Outlook clients that are supported by Microsoft. See the '`Remarks`' chapter in this section for possible limitations that may apply due to platform specific Microsoft restrictions.

The add-in always runs in the context of the user that is used by Outlook to access a mailbox. Delegate scenarios are supported. This means the following:
- User A has the Outlook add-in installed. The Outlook add-in can access all signature information that the Benefactor Circle add-on or the SimulateAndDeploy mode of Set-OutlookSignatures has written to the mailbox of user A. The add-in can be used in the mailbox of user A and in all other mailboxes that user A accesses with his own credentials.
- When user A has added a mailbox with separate credentials, such as adding shared mailbox B using shared mailbox B's credentials, the add-in installed in user A's mailbox will not work for shared mailbox B. Shared mailbox B needs to have the add-in installed, too, and the add-in only has access to signature information that the Benefactor Circle add-on or the SimulateAndDeploy mode of Set-OutlookSignatures has written to the shared mailbox B. For shared mailbox B, delegate scenarios are supported, too.

### 4.2.2. Web server and domain<!-- omit in toc -->
Whatever web server you choose, the requirements are low:
- Reachable from mobile devices via the public internet.
- Use a dedicated host name ("https://outlookaddin01.example.com"), do not use subdirectories ("https://addins.example.com/outlook01").
- A valid TLS certificate. Self-signed certificates can be used for development and testing, as long as the certificate is trusted by the client used for testing.
- In production, the server hosting the images shouldn't return a Cache-Control header specifying no-cache, no-store, or similar options in the HTTP response.

[Static website hosting in Azure Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website) can be an uncomplicated, cheap and fast alternative.

### 4.2.3 Set-OutlookSignatures<!-- omit in toc -->
The Outlook add-in can add existing signatures, but is not able to create them itself on the fly. The Benefactor Circle add-on prepares signature data in a way that it can be used by the Outlook add-in.

## 4.3. Configuration and deployment to the web server<!-- omit in toc -->
With every new release of Set-OutlookSignatures, [Benefactor Circle](Benefactor%20Circle.md) members not only receive an updated Benefactor Circle license file, but also an updated Outlook add-in.

With every new release of the Outlook add-in, you need to update your add-in deployment (sideloading M365 Centralized Deployment, M365 Integrated Apps) so that Outlook can download and use the newest code.

To configure the add-in and deploy it to your web server:
- Open '`run_before_deployment.ps1`' and follow the instructions in it to configure the add-in to your needs.
- You can configure the following settings:
  - The version number.
    Outlook add-ins have four version number parts. The first three parts match the version number of Set-OutlookSignatures, the last part is up to you.
  - The URL you deploy the add-in to.
  - On which Outlook hosts and platforms signatures shall be added automatically for new emails and email replies.
  - On which Outlook hosts and platforms signatures shall be added automatically for new appointments.
  - If you want or do not want to disable client signatures configured by your users.
  - Your cloud environment and the ID of the Entra ID app (required for Exchange Online mailboxes only).
  - Enable or disable debug logging.
- Run '`run_before_deployment.ps1`' in PowerShell.
- Upload the content of the '`publish`' folder to your web server.

When the '`manifest.xml`' file changes, you also need to update your app deployment in Exchange, so that your clients download the updated release. This is required when:
- A new release of the Outlook add-in is published by [ExplicIT Consulting](https://explicitconsulting.at).
- You change a configuration option in the '`run_before_deployment.ps1`' file which is marked to require an updated deployment.
- You modify the '`manifest.xml`' file manually.

## 4.4 Entra ID app<!-- omit in toc -->
When mailboxes are hosted in Exchange Online, the Outlook add-in needs an Entra ID app to access the mailbox.

Creating a separate Entra ID app for the Outlook add-in is strongly recommended over modifying an existing app.

You can run the following command to automatically create the Entra ID app. You need an Entra ID account with 'Application Administrator' or 'Global Admin' permissions.

```powershell
& '.\sample code\Create-EntraApp.ps1' -AppType 'OutlookAddIn' -AppName 'Set-OutlookSignatures Outlook Add-In' -OutlookAddInUrl '<https address to your web server>'
```

If you want to create the Entra ID app manually, the required minimum settings for the Entra ID app are:
- A name of your choice.
- A supported account type (it is strongly recommended to only allow access from users of your tenant).
- Authentication platform '`Single-page application`' with a redirect URI of '`brk-multihub://<your_deployment_domain>`'.
  If your DEPLOYMENT_URL is 'https://outlook-addin-01.example.com', the redirect URI must be '`brk-multihub://outlook-addin-01.example.com`'.
- Access to the following '`delegated`' (not application!) '`Graph API`' permissions:
  - '`Mail.Read`'
    Allows to read emails in mailbox of the currently logged-on user (and in no other mailboxes).
    Required because of Microsoft restrictions accessing roaming signatures.
- Grant admin consent for all permissions

## 4.5. Deployment to mailboxes<!-- omit in toc -->
### 4.5.1 Individual installation through users<!-- omit in toc -->
For mailboxes in Exchange Online:
- Open 'https://outlook.cloud.microsoft/mail/inclientstore'.
- Click on 'My add-ins'.
- Below 'Custom Addins', click on 'Add a custom add-in' and on 'Add from file'.
- In the file selection dialog, enter the manifest.xml file URL as file name and click on 'Open'.
- Click on 'Install'.
- Refresh the browser window.

 For mailboxes hosted on-prem:
 - Open 'https://YourMailServer.example.com/owa/#path=/options/manageapps'.
- Click on the plus sign to add an add-in, and choose 'Add from file'.
- In the file selection dialog, enter the manifest.xml file URL as file name and click on 'Open'.
- Click on 'Install'.
- Refresh the browser window.

Installation of add-ins may have been disabled by your administrators.

Do not use the URLs mentioned above to remove custom add-ins, as this fails most times. Instead, use one of the following options:
- Open Outlook for the web, draft a new mail, click on the 'Apps' button, right-click the Set-OutlookSignatures add-in and select 'Uninstall'.
- Remove the custom add-in in Outlook for Android or Outlook for iOS.
### 4.5.2 Microsoft 365 Centralized Deployment or Integrated Apps<!-- omit in toc -->
Centralized Deployment and deployment via Integrated Apps both provide the following benefits:
- An admin can deploy and assign an add-in directly to a user, to multiple users via a group, or to everyone in the organization.
- When the relevant Microsoft 365 app starts, the add-in automatically downloads. If the add-in supports add-in commands, the add-in automatically appears in the ribbon within the Microsoft 365 app.
- Add-ins no longer appear for users if the admin turns off or deletes the add-in, or if the user is removed from Microsoft Entra ID or from a group that the add-in is assigned to.

The Integrated Apps feature is the recommended way to deploy Outlook add-ins. It is not yet available for tenants in sovereign and government clouds, so in these environments you have to use Centralized Deployment instead.
- Details about Integrated Apps: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/test-and-deploy-microsoft-365-apps?view=o365-worldwide
- Details about Centralized Deployment: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/centralized-deployment-of-add-ins?view=o365-worldwide

## 4.6. Remarks<!-- omit in toc -->
**General**
- Microsoft is actively blocking access to roaming signatures for Outlook add-ins. The add-in will be updated when this block has been removed. In the meantime, the add-in has access to the data of the last run of Set-OutlookSignatures v4.14.0 and higher.
- The Microsoft APIs only allow access to online content. There is no way to access offline mailbox content or the file system. This means that the Outlook add-in only works when Outlook has an online connection to the user's mailbox.
- The easiest way to test the add-in and its basic functionality is to use the taskpane (see 'Usage' for details). For specific debugging on Android and iOS, you need to use the DEBUG option in '`run_before_deployment.ps1`'.
- The add-in can run automatically when one of the following launch events is triggered by Outlook: OnNewMessageCompose, OnNewAppointmentOrganizer, OnMessageFromChanged, OnAppointmentFromChanged.
  - Not all these events are supported on all platforms and editions of Outlook, see [this Microsoft article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/autolaunch#supported-events) for an up-to-date list.
  - While not publicly documented, [Outlook currently does not support add-ins on calendar invite responses](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js/issues/4094#issuecomment-1923444325).
- Microsoft dynamically updates the local copy of the office.js framework, there is no 1:1 relation between the version of Outlook and the version of the framework. This may lead to problems that suddenly appear although neither Outlook nor the add-in have changed. For example, the add-in may suddenly no longer work for shared mailboxes in Classic Outlook for Windows on some devices, while it does on others and in Outlook Web.
  - Where available, use the taskpane as a workaround. The taskpane is basically the same code with an additional graphical interface.
  - Use the DEBUG option in '`run_before_deployment.ps1`' to find out if the root cause is in Outlook or in the add-in. When there is no debug output, the launch event it not triggered by Outlook. When there is debug output, it will show where and with which error the add-in fails.
**Outlook for Android**
- Only mailboxes hosted in Exchange Online are supported. This is because Microsoft's mobile APIs do not allow programmatic access to mailboxes hosted on-prem.
- Setting the signature on new appointments is not yet supported by Microsoft.
- The Microsoft mobile APIs do not allow an add-in to show a taskpane when a new email, reply email or an appointment is created.

**Outlook for iOS**
- Only mailboxes hosted in Exchange Online are supported. This is because Microsoft's mobile APIs do not allow programmatic access to mailboxes hosted on-prem.
- Setting the signature on new appointments is not yet supported by Microsoft.
- The Microsoft mobile APIs do not allow an add-in to show a taskpane when a new email, reply email or an appointment is created.
- Microsoft will add support for iPads later (see [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/requirement-sets/common/nested-app-auth-requirement-sets?view=common-js-preview)).

**Outlook for Mac**
- Use the New Outlook for Mac whenever possible, as Classic Outlook for Mac (a.k.a Legacy Outlook for Mac) is at the end of its lifecycle.
- While the Microsoft APIs required for the Set-OutlookSignatures Outlook add-in are available in Classic Outlook for Mac, they are very unstable. Therefore, we only offer best-effort support for the add-in on Classic Outlook for Mac.

**Outlook Web on-prem**
- Launch events are not supported by Microsoft APIs, so only the taskpane works.
- Images are replaced with their alternate description. This will work as soon as Microsoft fixes a bug in their office.js API framework. If you are interested in a workaround, please let us know!

**Classic Outlook for Windows**
- Things work fine for mailboxes in Exchange Online, but the same Microsoft APIs seem to be unstable for on-prem mailboxes, especially regarding launch events (adding signatures automatically). When in doubt, use the taskpane.
- For Exchange Online mailboxes, the version used must support Nested App Authentication (see [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/faq-nested-app-auth-outlook-legacy-tokens#when-is-naa-generally-available-for-my-channel)).
  - Microsoft is disabling legacy Exchange Online tokens, but not all Outlook variants in support have enabled nested app authentication yet, leading to a situation where add-ins cannot authenticate. When Outlook is kept up-to-date, this should only affect the Semi Annual Extended Channel or outdated Outlook versions. See [this article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/turn-exchange-tokens-on-off) for instructions on how to detect this and how to temporarily re-enable legacy Exchange Online tokens.

# 5. Group membership  
## 5.1. Group membership in Entra ID<!-- omit in toc -->
When no Active Directory connection is available or the `GraphOnly` parameter is set to `true`, Entra ID is queried for transitive group membership via the Graph API. This query includes security and distribution groups.

Transitive means that not only direct group membership is considered, but also the membership resulting of groups being members of other groups, a.k.a. nested or indirect membership.

In Microsoft Graph, membership in dynamic groups is automatically considered.

## 5.1. Group membership in Active Directory<!-- omit in toc -->
When an Active Directory connection is available and the `GraphOnly` parameter ist not set to `true`, Active Directory is queried via LDAP.

Per default, all static security and distribution groups of group scopes global and universal are considered.

Group membership is evaluated against the whole Active Directory forest of the mailbox, and against all trusted domains (and their subdomains) the user has access to.

Group membership is evaluated transitively. Transitive means that not only direct group membership is considered, but also the membership resulting of groups being members of other groups, a.k.a. nested or indirect membership.

When Active Directory is used, SIDHistory is always included when evaluating group membership.

In Exchange resource forest scenarios with linked mailboxes, the group membership of the linked account (as populated in msExchMasterAccountSID) is not considered, only the group membership of the actual mailbox.

Group membership from Active Directory on-prem is retrieved by combining queries:
- Security groups are determined via the tokenGroupsGlobalAndUniversal attribute. Querying this attribute is nearly instant, resource saving on client and server, and also considers sIDHistory. This query includes security groups with the global or universal scope type in the whole forest.
- Distribution groups are queried via special LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN query that allows for very fast searching of group membership in the whole forest.
- Group membership across trusts is considered when the trusted domain/forest is included in TrustsToCheckForGroups, which is the default for all detected trusts. Cross-trust group membership is retrieved with an optimized LDAP query, considering the sID and sIDHistory of the group memberships retrieved in the steps before. This query only includes groups with the domain local scope type, as this is the only group type that can be used across trusts.

Only static groups are considered. Please see the FAQ section for detailed information why dynamic groups are not included in group membership queries on-prem.

Per default, the mailbox's own forest is not checked for membership in domain local groups, no matter if of type security or distribution. This is because querying for membership in domain local groups cannot be done fast, as there is no cache and every domain local group domain in the forest has to be queried for membership. Also, domain local groups are usually not used when granting permissions in Exchange. You can enable searching for domain local groups in the mailbox's forest by setting the parameter `IncludeMailboxForestDomainLocalGroups` to `$true`.

# 6. Run Set-OutlookSignatures while Outlook is running  
Outlook and Set-OutlookSignatures can run simultaneously.

On Windows, Outlook is never run or stopped by Set-OutlookSignatures. On macOS, Outlook may be started in the background, as this is a required by Outlook's engine for script access.

New and changed signatures can be used instantly in Outlook.

Changing which signature name is to be used as default signature for new emails or for replies and forwards requires restarting Outlook.   
# 7. Signature and OOF template file format  
Only Word files with the extension .docx and HTML files with the extension .htm are supported as signature and OOF template files.  
## 7.1. Relation between template file name and Outlook signature name<!-- omit in toc -->
The name of the signature template file without extension is the name of the signature in Outlook.
Example: The template "Test signature.docx" will create a signature named "Test signature" in Outlook.

This can be overridden in the INI file with the 'OutlookSignatureName' parameter.
Example: The template "Test signature.htm" with the following INI file configuration will create a signature named "Test signature, do not use".

```ini
[Test signature.htm]
OutlookSignatureName = Test signature, do not use
```

## 7.2. Proposed template and signature naming convention<!-- omit in toc -->
To make life easier for template maintainers and for users, a consistent template and signature naming convention should be used.

There are multiple approaches, with the following one gaining popularity: `<Company> <internal/external> <Language> <formal/informal> <additional info>`

Let's break down the components:
- Company: Useful when your users work with multiple company or brand names.
- Internal/External: Usually abbreviated as int and ext. Show if a signature is intended for use with a purely internal recipient audience, or if an external audience is involved.
- Language: Usually abbreviated to a two-letter code, such as AT for Austria. This way, you can handle multi-language signatures.
- Formal/informal: Usually abbreviated as frml and infrml. Allows you to deploy signatures with a certain formality in the salutation of the signature.
- Additional info: Typically used to identify signatures for shares mailboxes or in delegate scenarios.

Example signature names for a user having access to his own mailbox and the office mailbox:
- CompA ext DE frml
- CompA ext DE frml office@
- CompA ext DE infrml
- CompA ext DE infrml office@
- CompA ext EN frml
- CompA ext EN frml office@
- CompA ext EN infrml
- CompA ext EN infrml office@
- CompA int EN infrml
- CompA int EN infrml office@

For the user, the selection process may look complicated at first sight, but is actually quite natural and fast:
- Example A: Informal German mail sent to externals from own mailbox
  1. "I act in the name of company CompA" -> "CompA"
  2. "The mail has at least one external recipient" -> "CompA ext"
  3. "The mail is written in German language" -> "CompA ext DE"
  4. "The tone is informal" -> "CompA ext DE infrml"
  5. "I send from my own mailbox" -> no change, use "CompA ext DE infrml"
- Example B: Formal English mail sent to externals from office@
  1. "I act in the name of company CompA" -> "CompA"
  2. "The mail has at least one external recipient" -> "CompA ext"
  3. "The mail is written in English language" -> "CompA ext EN"
  4. "The tone is formal" -> "CompA ext EN frml"
  5. "I send from the office mailbox" -> "CompA ext EN frml office@"
- Example C: Internal English mail from own mailbox
  1. "I act in the name of company CompA" -> "CompA"
  2. "The mail has only internal recipients" -> "CompA int"
  3. "The mail is written in English language" -> "CompA int EN"
  4. "The tone is informal" -> "CompA int EN infrml"
  5. "I send from my own mailbox" -> "CompA int EN infrml"

Don't forget: You can use one and the same template for different signature names. In the example above, the template might not be named `CompA ext EN frml office@.docx`, but `CompA ext EN frml shared@.docx` and be used multiple times in the INI file:

```ini
# office@example.com
[CompA ext EN frml shared@.docx]
office@example.com
OutlookSignatureName = CompA ext EN frml office@
DefaultNew

# marketing@example.com
[CompA ext EN frml shared@.docx]
marketing@example.com
OutlookSignatureName = CompA ext EN frml marketing@
DefaultNew
```

# 8. Template tags and INI files
Tags define properties for templates, such as
- time ranges during which a template shall be applied or not applied
- groups whose direct or indirect members are allowed or denied application of a template
- specific email addresses (including alias and secondary addresses) which are are allowed or denied application of a template
- specific replacement variables which allow or deny application of a template
- an Outlook signature name that is different from the file name of the template
- if a signature template shall be set as default signature for new emails or as default signature for replies and forwards
- if a OOF template shall be set as internal or external message

There are additional tags which are not template specific, but change the behavior of Set-OutlookSignatures:
- specific sort order for templates (ascending, descending, as listed in the file)
- specific sort culture used for sorting ascendingly or descendingly (de-AT or en-US, for example)

If you want to give template creators control over the INI file, place it in the same folder as the templates.

Tags are case insensitive.
## 7.1. Allowed tags<!-- omit in toc -->
- Time range: `<yyyyMMddHHmm-yyyyMMddHHmm>`, `-:<yyyyMMddHHmm-yyyyMMddHHmm>`
  - Make this template valid only during the specific time range (`yyyy` = year, `MM` = month, `dd` = day, `HH` = hour (00-24), `mm` = minute).
  - The `-:` prefix makes this template invalid during the specified time range.
  - Examples: `202112150000-202112262359` for the 2021 Christmas season, `-:202202010000-202202282359` for a deny in February 2022
  - If the software does not run after a template has expired, the template is still available on the client and can be used.
  - Time ranges are interpreted as local time per default, which means times depend on the user or client configuration. If you do not want to use local times, but global times just add 'Z' as time zone. For example: `202112150000Z-202112262359Z`
  - This feature requires a Benefactor Circle license
- Assign template to group: `<DNS or NetBIOS name of AD domain> <SamAccountName of group>`, `<DNS or NetBIOS name of AD domain> <Display name of group>`, `-:<DNS or NetBIOS name of AD domain> <SamAccountName of group>`, `-:<DNS or NetBIOS name of AD domain> <Display name of group>`
  - Make this template specific for an Outlook mailbox being a direct or indirect member of this group or distribution list
  - The `-:` prefix makes this template invalid for the specified group.
  - Examples: `EXAMPLE Domain Users`, `-:Example GroupA`  
  - Groups must be available in Active Directory and/or Entra ID. Groups like `Everyone` and `Authenticated Users` only exist locally, not in Active Directory or Entra ID.
  - This tag supports alternative formats, which are of special interest if you are in a cloud only or hybrid environmonent:
    - `<DNS or NetBIOS name of AD domain> <SamAccountName of group>` and `<DNS or NetBIOS name of AD domain> <Display name of group>` can be queried from Microsoft Graph if the groups are synced between on-prem and the cloud. SamAccountName is queried before DisplayName. Use these formats when your environment is hybrid or on premises.
    - `EntraID <Object ID of group>`, `EntraID <securityIdenfifier of group>`, `EntraID <email-address-of-group@example.com>`, `EntraID <mailNickname of group>`, `EntraID <DisplayName of group>` do not work with a local Active Directory, only with Microsoft Graph. They are queried in the order given. You can use 'AzureAD' instead of 'EntraID'. 'EntraID' and 'AzureAD' are the literal, case-insensitive strings 'EntraID' and 'AzureAD', not a variable. Use these formats when you are in a hybrid or cloud only environment.
  - '`<DNS or NetBIOS name of AD domain>`' and '`<EXAMPLE>`' are just examples. You need to replace them with the actual NetBios domain name of the Active Directory domain containing the group.
  - 'EntraID' and 'AzureAD' are not examples. If you want to assign a template to a group stored in Entra ID, you have to use 'EntraID' or 'AzureAD' as domain name.
  - When multiple groups are defined, membership in a single group is sufficient to be assigned the template - it is not required to be a member of all the defined groups.  
  - Which group naming format should I choose?
    - When using the '`<DNS or NetBIOS name of AD domain> <…>`' format, use the SamAccountName whenever possible. The combination of domain name and SamAccountName is unique, while a display name may exist multiple times in a domain.
    - When using the '`EntraID <…>`' format, prefer Object ID and securityIdentifier whenever possible. Object ID and securityIdentifier are always unique, email address and mailNickname can wrongly exist on multiple objects, and the uniqueness of displayName is in your hands.
  - When should I refer on-prem groups and when Entra ID groups?
    - When using the '`-GraphOnly true`' parameter, prefer Entra ID groups ('`EntraID <…>`'). You may also use on-prem groups ('`<DNS or NetBIOS name of AD domain> <…>`') as long as they are synchronized to Entra ID.
    - In hybrid environments without using the '`-GraphOnly true`' parameter, prefer on-prem groups ('`<DNS or NetBIOS name of AD domain> <…>`') synchronized to Entra ID. Pure entra ID groups ('`EntraID <…>`') only make sense when all mailboxes covered by Set-OutlookSignatures are hosted in Exchange Online.
    - Pure on-prem environments: You can only use on-prem groups ('`<DNS or NetBIOS name of AD domain> <…>`'). When moving to a hybrid environment, you do not need to adapt the configuration as long as you synchronize your on-prem groups to Entra ID.
- Group membership of current user: `CURRENTUSER:<syntax of "Assign template to group">`
  - Make this template specific for the logged on user if his _personal_ mailbox (which does not need to be in Outlook) is a direct or indirect member of this group or distribution list
  - Example: Assign template to every mailbox, but not if the mailbox of the current user is member of the group EXAMPLE\Group

    ```ini
    [template.docx]
    -CURRENTUSER:EXAMPLE Group
    ```

- Email address: `<SmtpAddress>`, `-:<SmtpAddress>`
  - Make this template specific for the assigned email address (all SMTP addresses of a mailbox are considered, not only the primary one)
  - The `-:` prefix makes this template invalid for the specified email address.
  - Examples: `office@example.com`, `-:test@example.com`
  - The `CURRENTUSER:` and `-CURRENTUSER:` prefixes make this template invalid for the specified email addresses of the current user.  
  Example: Assign template to every mailbox, but not if the personal mailbox of the current user has the email address userX@example.com
  - Useful for delegate or boss-secretary scenarios: "Assign a template to everyone having the boss mailbox userA@example.com in Outlook, but not for UserA itself" is realized like that in the INI file:

    ```ini
    [delegate template name.docx]
    # Assign the template to everyone having userA@example.com in Outlook
    userA@example.com
    # Do not assign the template to the actual user owning the mailbox userA@example.com
    -CURRENTUSER:userA@example.com
    ```

    You can even only use only one delegate template for your whole company to cover all delegate scenarios. Make sure the template correctly uses `$CurrentUser[…]$` and `$CurrentMailbox[…]$` replacement variables, and then use the template multiple times in the INI file, with different signature names:

    ```ini
    [Company EN external formal delegate.docx]
    # Assign the template to everyone having userA@example.com in Outlook
    userA@example.com
    # Do not assign the template to the actual user owning the mailbox userA@example.com
    -CURRENTUSER:userA@example.com
    # Use a custom signature name instead of the template file name 
    OutlookSignatureName = Company EN external formal userA@


    [Company EN external formal delegate.docx]
    # Assign the template to everyone having userX@example.com in Outlook
    userX@example.com
    # Do not assign the template to the actual user owning the mailbox userX@example.com
    -CURRENTUSER:userX@example.com
    # Use a custom signature name instead of the template file name 
    OutlookSignatureName = Company EN external formal UserX@
    ```

- Replacement variable: `<ReplacementVariable>`, `-:<ReplacementVariable>`
  - Make this template specific for the assigned replacement variable
  - The `-:` prefix makes this template invalid for the specified replacement variable.
  - Replacement variable are checked for true or false values. If a replacement variable is not a boolean (true or false) value per se, it is converted to the boolean data type first.
    - Replacement variables that can only hold one value evaluate to false if they contain no value (null, empty) or have the value 0. All other values evaluate to true.
    - Replacement variables that can hold multiple values evaluate to false if they contain no value, or if they contain only one value, which in turn evaluates to false. All other values evaluate to true.
  - Examples:
    - `$CurrentMailboxManagerMail$` (apply if current user has a manager with an email address)
    - `-:$CurrentMailboxManagerMail$` (do not apply if current user has a manager with an email address)
    - A template should only be applied to users which are member of the Marketing group and the Sales group at the same time:
      - Use a custom replacement variable config file, define the custom replacement variable `$CurrentMailbox-IsMemberOf-MarketingAndSales$` and set it to yes if the current user's mailbox is member of the Marketing and the Sales groups at the same time:  

        ```powershell
        @(
                @('CurrentUser', '$CurrentUser-IsMemberOf-MarketingAndSales$', 'EXAMPLEDOMAIN Marketing', 'EXAMPLEDOMAIN Sales'),
                @()
        ) | Where-Object { $_ } | ForEach-Object {
                if (
                        $((Get-Variable -Name "ADProps$($_[0])" -ValueOnly).GroupsSids -icontains $(ResolveToSid($_[2]))) -and 
                        $((Get-Variable -Name "ADProps$($_[0])" -ValueOnly).GroupsSids -icontains $(ResolveToSid($_[3]))) 
                ) { 
                        $ReplaceHash[$_[1]] = 'yes'
                } else {
                        $ReplaceHash[$_[1]] = $null 
                } 
        }
        ```

      - The template INI configuration then looks like this:

        ```ini
        [template.docx]
        $CurrentUser-IsMemberOf-MarketingAndSales$
        ```

      - If you want a template only to not be applied to users whose primary mailbox is a of the Marketing group and the Sales group at the same time:

        ```ini
        [template.docx]
        -:$CurrentUser-IsMemberOf-MarketingAndSales$
        ```

      - Combinations are possible: Only in January 2024, for all members of EXAMPLEDOMAIN\Examplegroup but not for the mailbox example@example.com and not for users whose primary mailbox is a of the Marketing group and the Sales group at the same time:

        ```ini
        [template.docx]
        202401010000-202401312359
        EXAMPLEDOMAIN Examplegroup
        -:example@example.com
        -:$CurrentUser-IsMemberOf-MarketingAndSales$
        ```

- Write protect: `writeProtect`
    - Write protects the signature files. Works only in Classic Outlook for Windows. Modifying the signature in Outlook's signature editor leads to an error on saving, but the signature can still be changed after it has been added to an email.  
- Set signature as default for new emails: `defaultNew` (signature template files only)  
    - Set signature as default signature for new mails  
- Set signature as default for replies and forwarded emails: `defaultReplyFwd` (signature template files only)  
    - Set signature as default signature for replies and forwarded mails  
- Set OOF reply as default for internal recipients: `internal` (OOF template files only)  
    - Set template as default OOF message for internal recipients  
    - If neither `internal` nor `external` is defined, the template is set as default OOF message for internal and external recipients  
- Set OOF reply as default for external recipients: `external` (OOF template files only)  
    - Set template as default OOF message for external recipients  
    - If neither `internal` nor `external` is defined, the template is set as default OOF message for internal and external recipients

<br>Tags can be combined: A template may be assigned to several groups, email addresses and time ranges, be denied for several groups, email adresses and time ranges, be used as default signature for new emails and as default signature for replies and forwards - all at the same time. Simple add different tags below a file name, separated by line breaks (each tag needs to be on a separate line).

## 7.2. How to work with INI files<!-- omit in toc -->
1. Comments  
  Comment lines start with '#' or ';'  
	Whitespace at the beginning and the end of a line is ignored  
  Empty lines are ignored  
2. Use the INI files in `.\templates\Signatures DOCX with ini` and `.\templates\Out-of-Office DOCX with ini` as templates and starting point
3. Put file names with extensions in square brackets  
  Example: `[Company external English formal.docx]`  
  Putting file names in single or double quotes is possible, but not necessary.  
  File names are case insensitive
    `[file a.docx]` is the same as `["File A.docx"]` and `['fILE a.dOCX']`  
  File names not mentioned in this file are not considered, even if they are available in the file system. Set-OutlookSignatures will report files which are in the file system but not mentioned in the current ini, and vice versa.<br>  
  When there are two or more sections for a filename: The keys and values are not combined, each section is considered individually (SortCulture and SortOrder still apply).  
  This can be useful in the following scenario: Multiple shared mailboxes shall use the same template, individualized by using `$CurrentMailbox[…]$` variables. A user can have multiple of these shared mailboxes in his Outlook configuration.
    - Solution A: Use multiple templates (possible in all versions)
      - Instructions
        - Create a copy of the initial template for each shared mailbox.
        - For each template copy, create a corresponding INI entry which assigns the template copy to a specific email address (including alias and secondary addresses).
      - Result
        - Templates<br>One template file for each shared mailbox
          - `template shared mailbox A.docx`
          - `template shared mailbox B.docx`
          - `template shared mailbox C.docx`
        - INI file

          ```ini
          [template shared mailbox A.docx]
          SharedMailboxA@example.com

          [template shared mailbox B.docx]
          SharedMailboxB@example.com

          [template shared mailbox C.docx]
          SharedMailboxC@example.com
          ```

    - Solution B: Use only one template (possible with v3.1.0 and newer)
      - Instructions
        - Create a single initial template.
        - For each shared mailbox, create a corresponding INI entry which assigns the template to a specific email address (including alias and secondary addresses) and defines a separate Outlook signature name.
      - Result
        - Templates<br>One template file for all shared mailboxes
          - `template shared mailboxes.docx`
        - INI file

          ```ini
          [template shared mailboxes.docx]
          SharedMailboxA@example.com
          OutlookSignatureName = template SharedMailboxA

          [template shared mailboxes.docx]
          SharedMailboxB@example.com
          OutlookSignatureName = template SharedMailboxB

          [template shared mailboxes.docx]
          SharedMailboxC@example.com
          OutlookSignatureName = template SharedMailboxC
          ```

    You can even only use only one delegate template for your whole company to cover all delegate scenarios. Make sure the template correctly uses `$CurrentUser[…]$` and `$CurrentMailbox[…]$` replacement variables, and then use the template multiple times in the INI file, with different signature names:

    ```ini
    [Company EN external formal delegate.docx]
    # Assign the template to everyone having userA@example.com in Outlook
    userA@example.com
    # Do not assign the template to the actual user owning the mailbox userA@example.com
    -CURRENTUSER:userA@example.com
    # Use a custom signature name instead of the template file name 
    OutlookSignatureName = Company EN external formal userA@


    [Company EN external formal delegate.docx]
    # Assign the template to everyone having userX@example.com in Outlook
    userX@example.com
    # Do not assign the template to the actual user owning the mailbox userX@example.com
    -CURRENTUSER:userX@example.com
    # Use a custom signature name instead of the template file name 
    OutlookSignatureName = Company EN external formal UserX@
    ```

4. Add tags in the lines below the filename
  Example: `defaultNew`
    - Do not enclose tags in square brackets. This is not allowed here, but required when you add tags directly to file names.    - When an INI file is used, tags in file names are not considered as tags, but as part of the file name, so the Outlook signature name will contain them.  
    - Only one tag per line is allowed.
    Adding not a single tag to file name section is valid. The signature template is then classified as a common template.
    - Putting file names in single or double quotes is possible, but not necessary
    - Tags are case insensitive  
    `defaultNew` is the same as `DefaultNew` and `dEFAULTnEW`
    - You can override the automatic Outlook signature name generation by setting OutlookSignatureName, e. g. `OutlookSignatureName = This is a custom signature name`  
    With this option, you can have different template file names for the same Outlook signature name. Search for "Marketing external English formal" in the sample INI files for an example. Take care of signature group priorities (common, group, email address, replacement variable) and the SortOrder and SortCulture parameters.
5. Remove the tags from the file names in the file system  
Else, the file names in the INI file and the file system do not match, which will result in some templates not being applied.  
It is recommended to create a copy of your template folder for tests.
6. Make the software use the INI file by passing the `SignatureIniFile` and/or `OOFIniFile` parameter
# 9. Signature and OOF application order  
Signatures are applied mailbox for mailbox. The mailbox list is sorted as follows (from highest to lowest priority):
- Mailbox of the currently logged-in user
- Mailboxes from the default Outlook profile, in the sort order shown in Outlook (and not in the order they were added to the Outlook profile)
- Mailboxes from other Outlook profiles. The profiles are sorted alphabetically. Within each profile, the mailboxes are sorted in the order they are shown in Outlook.

For each mailbox, templates are applied in a specific order: Common templates first, group templates second, email address specific templates third, replacement variables last.

Each one of these templates groups can have one or more time range tags assigned. Such a template is only considered if the current system time is within at least one of these time range tags.
- Common templates are templates with either no tag or only `[defaultNew]` and/or `[defaultReplyFwd]` (`[internal]` and/or `[external]` for OOF templates).
- Within these template groups, templates are sorted according to the sort order and sort culture defines in the configuration file.
- Every centrally stored signature template is only applied to the mailbox with the highest priority allowed to use it. This ensures that no mailbox with lower priority can overwrite a signature intended for a higher priority mailbox.

OOF templates are only applied if the out-of-office assistant is currently disabled. If it is currently active or scheduled to be automatically activated in the future, OOF templates are not applied.  
# 10. Replacement variables  
Replacement variables are case insensitive placeholders in templates which are replaced with actual user or mailbox values at runtime.

Replacement variables are replaced everywhere, including links, QuickTips and alternative text of images.

With this feature, you cannot only show email addresses and telephone numbers in the signature and OOF message, but show them as links which open a new email message (`"mailto:"`) or dial the number (`"tel:"`) via a locally installed softphone when clicked.

Custom Active directory attributes are supported as well as custom replacement variables, see `.\config\default replacement variables.ps1` for details.  
Attributes from Microsoft Graph need to be mapped, this is done in `.\config\default graph config.ps1`.

Variables can also be retrieved from other sources than Active Directory by adding custom code to the variable config file.

Per default, `.\config\default replacement variables.ps1` contains the following replacement variables:  
- Currently logged-in user  
    - `$CurrentUserGivenName$`: Given name  
    - `$CurrentUserSurname$`: Surname  
    - `$CurrentUserDepartment$`: Department  
    - `$CurrentUserTitle$`: (Job) Title  
    - `$CurrentUserStreetAddress$`: Street address  
    - `$CurrentUserPostalcode$`: Postal code  
    - `$CurrentUserLocation$`: Location  
    - `$CurrentUserState$`: State  
    - `$CurrentUserCountry$`: Country  
    - `$CurrentUserTelephone$`: Telephone number  
    - `$CurrentUserFax$`: Facsimile number  
    - `$CurrentUserMobile$`: Mobile phone  
    - `$CurrentUserMail$`: email address  
    - `$CurrentUserPhoto$`: Photo from Active Directory, see "[12.1 Photos from Active Directory](#121-photos-from-active-directory)" for details  
    - `$CurrentUserPhotoDeleteEmpty$`: Photo from Active Directory, see "[12.1 Photos from Active Directory](#121-photos-from-active-directory)" for details  
    - `$CurrentUserExtAttr1$` to `$CurrentUserExtAttr15$`: Exchange extension attributes 1 to 15  
    - `$CurrentUserOffice$`: Office room number (physicalDeliveryOfficeName)  
    - `$CurrentUserCompany$`: Company  
    - `$CurrentUserMailNickname$`: Alias (mailNickname)  
    - `$CurrentUserDisplayName$`: Display Name  
- Manager of currently logged-in user  
    - Same variables as logged-in user, `$CurrentUserManager[…]$` instead of `$CurrentUser[…]$`  
- Current mailbox  
    - Same variables as logged-in user, `$CurrentMailbox[…]$` instead of `$CurrentUser[…]$`  
- Manager of current mailbox  
    - Same variables as logged-in user, `$CurrentMailboxManager[…]$` instead of `$CurrentMailbox[…]$`  
## 9.1. Photos from Active Directory (account pictures, user image)<!-- omit in toc -->
The software supports replacing images in signature templates with photos stored in Active Directory.

When using images in OOF templates, please be aware that Exchange and Outlook do not yet support images in OOF messages.

As with other variables, photos can be obtained from the currently logged-in user, it's manager, the currently processed mailbox and it's manager.
  
### 9.1.1. When using DOCX template files<!-- omit in toc -->
To be able to apply Word image features such as sizing, cropping, frames, 3D effects etc, you have to exactly follow these steps:  
1. Create a sample image file which will later be used as placeholder.  
2. Optionally: If the sample image file name contains one of the following variable names, the software recognizes it and you do not need to add the value to the alternative text of the image in step 4:  
    - `$CurrentUserPhoto$`  
    - `$CurrentUserPhotoDeleteEmpty$`  
    - `$CurrentUserManagerPhoto$`  
    - `$CurrentUserManagerPhotoDeleteEmpty$`  
    - `$CurrentMailboxPhoto$`  
    - `$CurrentMailboxPhotoDeleteEmpty$`  
    - `$CurrentMailboxManagerPhoto$`  
    - `$CurrentMailboxManagerPhotoDeleteEmpty$`  
3. Insert the image into the signature template. Make sure to use `Insert | Pictures | This device` (Word 2019, other versions have the same feature in different menus) and to select the option `Insert and Link` - if you forget this step, a specific Word property is not set and the software will not be able to replace the image.  
4. If you did not follow optional step 2, please add one of the following variable names to the alternative text of the image in Word (these variables are removed from the alternative text in the final signature):  
    - `$CurrentUserPhoto$`  
    - `$CurrentUserPhotoDeleteEmpty$`  
    - `$CurrentUserManagerPhoto$`  
    - `$CurrentUserManagerPhotoDeleteEmpty$`  
    - `$CurrentMailboxPhoto$`  
    - `$CurrentMailboxPhotoDeleteEmpty$`  
    - `$CurrentMailboxManagerPhoto$`  
    - `$CurrentMailboxManagerPhotoDeleteEmpty$`  
5. Format the image as wanted.

For the software to recognize images to replace, you need to follow at least one of the steps 2 and 4. If you follow both, the software first checks for step 2 first. If you provide multiple image replacement variables, `$CurrentUser[…]$` has the highest priority, followed by `$CurrentUserManager[…]$`, `$CurrentMailbox[…]$` and `$CurrentMailboxManager[…]$`. It is recommended to use only one image replacement variable per image.  
  
The software will replace all images meeting the conditions described in the steps above and replace them with Active Directory photos in the background. This keeps Word image formatting option alive, just as if you would use Word's `"Change picture"` function.  

### 9.1.2. When using HTM template files<!-- omit in toc -->
Images are replaced when the `src` or `alt` property of the image tag contains one of the following strings:
- `$CurrentUserPhoto$`  
- `$CurrentUserPhotoDeleteEmpty$`  
- `$CurrentUserManagerPhoto$`  
- `$CurrentUserManagerPhotoDeleteEmpty$`  
- `$CurrentMailboxPhoto$`  
- `$CurrentMailboxPhotoDeleteEmpty$`  
- `$CurrentMailboxManagerPhoto$`  
- `$CurrentMailboxManagerPhotoDeleteEmpty$`

Be aware that Outlook does not support the full HTML feature set. For example:
- Some (older) Outlook versions ignore the `width` and `height` properties for embedded images.  
  To overcome this limitation, use images in a connected folder (such as `Test all default replacement variables.files` in the sample templates folder) and additionally set the Set-OutlookSignatures parameter `EmbedImagesInHtml` to ``false`.
- Text and image formatting are limited, especially when HTML5 or CSS features are used.
- Consider switching to DOCX templates for easier maintenance.
### 9.1.3. Common behavior<!-- omit in toc -->
If there is no photo available in Active Directory, there are two options:  
- You used the `$Current[…]Photo$` variables: The sample image used as placeholder is shown in the signature.  
- You used the `$Current[…]PhotoDeleteempty$` variables: The sample image used as placeholder is deleted from the signature, which may affect the layout of the remaining signature depending on your formatting options.

**Attention**: A signature with embedded images has the expected file size in DOCX, HTML and TXT formats, but the RTF file will be much bigger.

The signature template `.\templates\Signatures DOCX\Test all signature replacement variables.docx` contains several embedded images and can be used for a file comparison:  
- .docx: 23 KB  
- .htm: 87 KB  
- .RTF without workaround: 27.5 MB  
- .RTF with workaround: 1.4 MB
  
The software uses a workaround, but the resulting RTF files are still huge compared to other file types and especially for use in emails. If this is a problem, please either do not use embedded images in the signature template (including photos from Active Directory), or switch to HTML formatted emails.

If you ran into this problem outside this script, please consider modifying the ExportPictureWithMetafile setting as described in  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/224663" target="_blank">this Microsoft article</a>.  
If the link is not working, please visit the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180827213151/https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/224663/document-file-size-increases-with-emf-png-gif-or-jpeg-graphics-in-word" target="_blank">Internet Archive Wayback Machine's snapshot of Microsoft's article</a>.  
## 9.2. Delete images when attribute is empty, variable content based on group membership<!-- omit in toc -->
You can avoid creating multiple templates which only differ by the images contained by only creating one template containing all images and marking this images to be deleted when a certain replacement variable is empty.

Just add the text `$<name of the replacement variable>DELETEEMPTY$` (for example: `$CurrentMailboxExtAttr10DeleteEmpty$` ) to the description or alt text of the image. Taking the example, the image is deleted when extension attribute 10 of the current mailbox is empty.

This can be combined with the `GroupsSIDs` attribute of the current mailbox or current user to only keep images when the mailbox is member of a certain group.

Examples:
- A signature should only show a social network icon with an associated link when there is data in the extension attribute 10 of the mailbox:
  - Insert the icon of the social network in the template, set the hyperlink target to '$CurrentMailboxExtAttr10$' and add '$CurrentMailboxExtAttr10Deleteempty$' to the description of the picture.
    - When using embedded and linked pictures, you can also set the file name to '$CurrentMailboxExtAttr10Deleteempty$'
- A signature should only contain a certain image when the current mailbox is a member of the Marketing group:
  - Create a new replacement variable. We use '$CurrentMailbox-ismemberof-marketing$' in the following example.
    - Attention on-prem users: If Domain Local Active Directory groups are involved, you need to set the `IncludeMailboxForestDomainLocalGroups` parameter to `true` when running Set-OutlookSignatures, so that the SIDs of these groups are considered too.
    - If the current mailbox is a member, give '$CurrentMailbox-ismemberof-marketing$' any value. If not, give '$CurrentMailbox-ismemberof-marketing$' no value (NULL or an empty string).
    - You only have to modify three strings right at the beginning:

      ```powershell
      # Check if current mailbox is member of group 'EXAMPLEDOMAIN\Marketing' and set $ReplaceHash['$CurrentMailbox-ismemberof-marketing$'] accordingly
      #
      # Replace 'EXAMPLEDOMAIN Marketing' with the domain and group you are searching for. Use 'EntraID' or 'AzureAD' instead of 'EXAMPLEDOMAIN' to only search Entra ID/Graph
      # Replace '$CurrentMailbox-ismemberof-marketing$' with the replacement variable that should be used
      # Replace 'CurrentMailbox' with 'CurrentUser' if you do not want to check the current mailbox group SIDs, but the group SIDs of the current user's mailbox
      #
      # The 'GroupsSIDs' attribute is available for the current mailbox and the current user, but not for the managers of these two
      #   It contains the mailboxes' SID and SIDHistory, the SID and SIDHistory of all groups the mailbox belongs to (nested), and also considers group membership (nested) across trusts.
      #   Attention on-prem users: If Active Directory groups of the Domain Local type are queried, you need to set the `IncludeMailboxForestDomainLocalGroups` parameter to `true` when running Set-OutlookSignatures, so that the SIDs of these groups are considered in GroupsSIDs, too.
      @(
              @('CurrentMailbox', '$CurrentMailbox-IsMemberOf-Marketing$', 'EXAMPLEDOMAIN Marketing'), 
              @()
      ) | Where-Object { $_ } | ForEach-Object {
              if ((Get-Variable -Name "ADProps$($_[0])" -ValueOnly).GroupsSids -icontains ResolveToSid($_[2])) {
                      $ReplaceHash[$_[1]] = 'yes'
              } else { 
                      $ReplaceHash[$_[1]] = $null 
              } 
      }
      ```

  - Insert the image in the template, and add '$CurrentMailbox-IsMemberOf-MarketingDeleteempty$' to the description of the picture.
    - When using embedded and linked pictures, you can also set the file name to '$CurrentMailbox-IsMemberOf-MarketingDeleteempty$'
## 9.3. Custom image replacement variables<!-- omit in toc -->
You can fill custom image replacement variables yourself with a byte array: `'$CurrentUserCustomImage[1..10]$'`, `'$CurrentUserManagerCustomImage[1..10]$'`, `'$CurrentMailboxCustomImage[1..10]$'`, `'$CurrentMailboxManagerCustomImage[1..10]$'`.

Use cases: Account pictures from a share, QR code vCard/URL/text/Twitter/X/Facebook/App stores/geo location/email, etc.

Per default, `'$Current[..]CustomImage1$'` is a QR code containing a vCard (in MeCard format) - see file `'.\config\default replacement variables.ps1'` for the code behind it.

The behavior of custom image replacement variables and the possible configuration options are the same as with replacement variables for account pictures from Active Directory/Entra ID.

As practical as QR codes may be, they should contain as little information as possible. The more information they contain, the larger the image needs to be, which often has a negative impact on the layout and always has a negative impact on the size of the email.<br>QR codes with too much information and too small an image size become visually blurred, making them impossible to scan - for DOCX templates, `DocxHighResImageConversion` can help. Consider bigger image size, less content, less error correction, MeCard instead of vCard, and pointing to an URL containing the actual information.
# 11. Outlook Web  
If the currently logged-in user has configured his personal mailbox in Outlook, the default signature for new emails is configured in Outlook Web automatically.

If the default signature for new mails matches the one used for replies and forwarded email, this is also set in Outlook.

If different signatures for new and reply/forward are set, only the new signature is copied to Outlook Web.

If only a default signature for replies and forwards is set, only this new signature is copied to Outlook Web.

If there is no default signature in Outlook, Outlook Web settings are not changed.

All this happens with the credentials of the currently logged-in user, without any interaction neccessary.  
# 12. Hybrid and cloud-only support
Set-OutlookSignatures supports three directory environments:
- Active Directory on premises. This requires direct connection to Active Directory Domain Controllers, which usually only works when you are connected to your company network.
- Hybrid. This environment consists of an Active Directory on premises, which is synced with Microsoft Entra ID in the cloud.  
  Make sure that all signature relevant groups (if applicable) are available as well on-prem and in the cloud, and also ensure this for mail related attributes: At least legacyExchangeDN, msexchrecipienttypedetails, msExchMailboxGuid and proxyaddresses - see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/connect/reference-connect-sync-attributes-synchronized for details. Make sure that the mail attribute in any environment is set to the users primary SMTP address - it may only be empty on the linked user account in the on-prem resource forest scenario.  
  If the software can't make a connection to your on-prem environment, it tries to get required data from the cloud via the Microsoft Graph API.
- Cloud-only. This environment has no Active Directory on premises, or does not sync mail attributes between the cloud and the on-prem enviroment. The software does not connect to your on-prem environment, only to the cloud via the Microsoft Graph API.

The software parameter `GraphOnly` defines which directory environment is used:
- `-GraphOnly false` or not passing the parameter: On-prem AD first, Entra ID only when on-prem AD cannot be reached
- `-GraphOnly true`: Entra ID only, even when on-prem AD could be reached
## 11.1. Basic Configuration<!-- omit in toc -->
To allow communication between Microsoft Graph and Set-Outlooksignatures, both need to be configured for each other.

The easiest way is to once start Set-OutlookSignatures with a cloud administrator. The administrator then gets asked for admin consent for the correct permissions:
1. Log on with a user that has administrative rights in Entra ID.
2. Run `Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 -GraphOnly true`
3. When asked for credentials, provide your Entra ID admin credentials
4. For the required permissions, grant consent in the name of your organization

If you don't want to use custom Graph attributes or other advanced configurations, no more configuration in Microsoft Graph or Set-OutlookSignatures is required.

If you prefer using own application IDs or need advanced configuration, follow these steps:  
- In Entra ID, create a new application with the settings described in '`.\config\default graph config.ps1`'.
- In Set-OutlookSignatures, use '`.\config\default graph config.ps1`' as a template for a custom Graph configuration file
  - Set '`$GraphClientID`' to the application ID created by the Graph administrator before, or pass this value using the '`GraphClientID`' parameter.
  - Use the `GraphConfigFile` parameter to make the tool use the newly created Graph configuration file.
## 11.2. Advanced Configuration<!-- omit in toc -->
The Graph configuration file allows for additional, advanced configuration:
- `$GraphEndpointVersion`: The version of the Graph REST API to use
- `$GraphUserProperties`: The properties to load for each graph user/mailbox. You can add custom attributes here.
- `$GraphUserAttributeMapping`: Graph and Active Directory attributes are not named identically. Set-OutlookSignatures therefore uses a "virtual" account. Use this hashtable to define which Graph attribute name is assigned to which attribute of the virtual account.  
The virtual account is accessible as `$ADPropsCurrentUser[…]` in `.\config\default replacement variables.ps1`, and therefore has a direct impact on replacement variables.
## 11.3. Authentication<!-- omit in toc -->
In hybrid and cloud-only scenarios, Set-OutlookSignatures automatically tries multiple ways to authenticate the user. Silent methods, also known as non-interactive methods, are preferred as they are invisible to the user.
1. Silent via Integrated Windows Authentication without login hint  
This works in hybrid scenarios when you configured your hybrid connection in Entra Connect accordingly, and when the user is logged-on to a domain- or Entra-ID-joined computer with his domain credentials. The credentials of the currently logged-in user are used to access Microsoft Graph without any further user interaction.  
Integrated Windows Authentication only works for federated users (users created in Active Directory and then synced to Entra ID), not for managed users (users created in Entra ID and then synced to Entra ID).  
Integrated Windows Authentication only works for domains with the authentication type "federated". You can check the authentication type for your domains with the '`Get-MgDomain`' cmdlet from the Microsoft.Graph.Identity.DirectoryManagement PowerShell module.  
See '`https://aka.ms/msal-net-iwa`' for details.
2. Silent via Integrated Windows Authentication with login hint  
This is the same as the option before, but with a login hint taken from the last known successful authentication. Windows requires this in some scenarios.
3. Silent via Authentication Broker without login hint  
Like Integrated Windows Authentication, this method takes the currently logged-in user and tries to silently authenticate using the Authentication Broker.  
This allows silent authentication in environmentes where Integrated Windows Authentication is not an option, but users are logging on with their Entra ID account.
4. Silent via Authentication Broker with login hint  
The Authentication Broker of the operating system is asked to silently authenticate the user that was used to run Set-OutlookSignatures the last time.
5. Silent via refresh token  
Entra ID is directly asked to silently authenticate the user that was used to run Set-OutlookSignatures the last time. Technically, Entra ID is asked to validate a cached refresh token and to issue an access token.
6. Interactive via Authentication Broker  
The authentication broker of the operating system opens, asks which account to use and takes care of authentication.
7. Interactive via browser  
Authentication via browser. A default browser window with an "Authentication successful" message may open, it can be closed anytime. You can modify the browser message shown, see '.\config\default graph config.ps1' for details.

When all silent authentication methods fail, a dialog informs the user that Set-OutlookSignatures requires interactive authentication. You can change the text displayed in the dialog or disable the dialog using a custom graph configuration file. See '`.\config\default graph config.ps1`' for details and more options related to authentication against the Graph API.

No custom components are used, only the official Microsoft 365 authentication site, the user's default browser and the official Microsoft Authentication Library for .Net (MSAL.Net).

After successful authentication the refresh token is stored for later use by the silent authentication steps described above.
- On Windows, the file is encrypted using the system's Data Protection API (DPAPI) and saved in the file `$(Join-Path -Path ([Environment]::GetFolderPath([Environment+SpecialFolder]::LocalApplicationData)) -ChildPath '\Set-OutlookSignatures\MSAL.PS\MSAL.PS.msalcache.bin3')`.
  - In the rare case that DPAPI is not available, Set-OutlookSignatures informs you and MSAL.Net saves the file unencrypted.
- On Linux, the refresh token is stored in the default keyring in the entry named 'Set-OutlookSignatures Microsoft Graph token via MSAL.Net'. If the default keyring is locked, the user is asked to unlock it (the message can be customized in 'default graph config.ps1').
  - Should the default keyring not be available, Set-OutlookSignatures informs you and MSAL.Net saves the refresh token in the file `$(Join-Path -Path ([Environment]::GetFolderPath([Environment+SpecialFolder]::LocalApplicationData)) -ChildPath '\Set-OutlookSignatures\MSAL.PS\MSAL.PS.msalcache.bin3')`.
- On macOS, the refresh token is stored in the default keychain in the entry named 'Set-OutlookSignatures Microsoft Graph token via MSAL.Net'. If the default keychain is locked, the user is asked to unlock it (the message can be customized in 'default graph config.ps1').
  - Should the default keychain not be available, Set-OutlookSignatures informs you and MSAL.Net saves the refresh token in the file `$(Join-Path -Path ([Environment]::GetFolderPath([Environment+SpecialFolder]::LocalApplicationData)) -ChildPath '\Set-OutlookSignatures\MSAL.PS\MSAL.PS.msalcache.bin3')`.

Set-OutlookSignatures always keeps you informed about where and how the token is stored, and how you can delete it to force re-authentication without using the cached refresh token:
- Windows
  - '`Encrypted file '$($cacheFilePath)', delete file to remove cached token`'
  - '`Unencrypted file '$($cacheFilePath)', delete file to remove cached token`'
- Linux
  - '`Encrypted default keyring entry 'Set-OutlookSignatures Microsoft Graph token via MSAL.Net', use keychain app to remove cached token`'
  - '`Unencrypted file '$($cacheFilePath)', delete file to remove cached token`'
- macOS
  - '`Encrypted default keychain entry 'Set-OutlookSignatures Microsoft Graph token via MSAL.Net', use 'security delete-generic-password "Set-OutlookSignatures Microsoft Graph token via MSAL.Net"' to remove cached token`'
  - '`Unencrypted file '$($cacheFilePath)', delete file to remove cached token`'

If you want to see more information around authentication, run Set-OutlookSignatures with the "-verbose" parameter.

If a user executes Set-OutlookSignatures on a client several times in succession and is asked for authentication each time:
- Run Set-OutlookSignatures with the "-verbose" parameter to see details about authentication.
- Check your MFA configuration and Conditional Access Policies in Entra ID. You may have not considered script access in your policies (you should see a hint to that in the error message displayed when run with "-verbose").
-	Ensure that Set-OutlookSignatures is run in the security context of the user, and not in another security context such as SYSTEM (which is a common mistake when using Intune remediation scripts).
- Ensure that the cache file or keyring/keychain entry is not deleted between separate runs of Set-OutlookSignatures for the same user on the same machine.
# 13. Simulation mode  
Simulation mode is enabled when the parameter `SimulateUser` is passed to the software. It answers the question `"What will the signatures look like for user A, when Outlook is configured for the mailboxes X, Y and Z?"`.

Simulation mode is useful for content creators and admins, as it allows to simulate the behavior of the software and to inspect the resulting signature files before going live.
  
In simulation mode, Outlook registry entries are not considered and nothing is changed in Outlook and Outlook web.

The template files are handled just as during a real script run, but only saved to the folder passed by the parameters AdditionalSignaturePath and AdditionalSignaturePath folder.
  
`SimulateUser` is a mandatory parameter for simulation mode. This value replaces the currently logged-in user. Use a logon name in the format 'Domain\User' or a Universal Principal Name (UPN, looks like an email address, but is not neecessarily one).

`SimulateMailboxes` is optional for simulation mode, although highly recommended. It is a comma separated list of email addresses replacing the list of mailboxes otherwise gathered from the registry.

`SimulateTime` is optional for simulation mode. Simulating a certain time is helpful when time-based templates are used.

**Attention**: Simulation mode only works when the user starting the simulation is at least from the same Active Directory forest as the user defined in SimulateUser.  Users from other forests will not work.

## 14.1. Where can I find the changelog?<!-- omit in toc -->
The changelog is located in the `.\docs` folder, along with other documents related to Set-OutlookSignatures.
## 14.2. How can I contribute, propose a new feature or file a bug?<!-- omit in toc -->
If you have an idea for a new feature or have found a problem, please <a href="https://github.com/Set-OutlookSignatures/Set-OutlookSignatures/issues" target="_blank">create an issue on GitHub</a>.

If you want to contribute code, please have a look at `.\docs\CONTRIBUTING` for a rough overview of the proposed process.
## 14.3. How is the account of a mailbox identified?<!-- omit in toc -->
The legacyExchangeDN attribute is the preferred method to find the account of a mailbox, as this also works in specific scenarios where the mail and proxyAddresses attribute is not sufficient:
- Separate Active Directory forests for users and Exchange mailboxes: In this case, the mail attribute is usually set in the user forest, although there are no mailboxes in this forest.
- One common email domain across multiple Exchange organizations: In this case, the address book is very like synchronized between Active Directory forests by using contacts or mail-enabled users, which both will have the SMTP address of the mailbox in the proxyAddresses attribute.

The legacyExchangeDN search considers migration scenarios where the original legacyExchangeDN is only available as X500 address in the proxyAddresses attribute of the migrated mailbox, or where the the mailbox in the source system has been converted to a mail enabled user still having the old legacyExchangeDN attribute.

If Outlook does not have information about the legacyExchangeDN of a mailbox (for example, when accessing a mailbox via protocols such as POP3 or IMAP4), the account behind a mailbox is searched by checking if the email address of the mailbox can be found in the proxyAddresses attribute of an account in Active Directory/Graph.

If the account behind a mailbox is found, group membership information can be retrieved and group specific templates can be applied.
If the account behind a mailbox is not found, group membership cannot be retrieved, and group and replacement variable specific templates cannot be applied. Such mailboxes can still receive common and mailbox specific signatures and OOF messages.  
## 14.4. How is the personal mailbox of the currently logged-in user identified?<!-- omit in toc --> 
The personal mailbox of the currently logged-in user is preferred to other mailboxes, as it receives signatures first and is the only mailbox where the Outlook Web signature can be set.

The personal mailbox is found by simply checking if the Active Directory mail attribute of the currently logged-in user matches an SMTP address of one of the mailboxes connected in Outlook.

If the mail attribute is not set, the currently logged-in user's objectSID is compared with all the mailboxes' msExchMasterAccountSID. If there is exactly one match, this mailbox is used as primary one.
  
Please consider the following caveats regarding the mail attribute:  
- When Active Directory attributes are directly modified to create or modify users and mailboxes (instead of using Exchange Admin Center or Exchange Management Shell), the mail attribute is often not updated and does not match the primary SMTP address of a mailbox. Microsoft strongly recommends that the mail attribute matches the primary SMTP address.  
- When using linked mailboxes, the mail attribute of the linked account is often not set or synced back from the Exchange resource forest. Technically, this is not necessary. From an organizational point of view it makes sense, as this can be used to determine if a specific user has a linked mailbox in another forest, and as some applications (such as "scan to email") may need this attribute anyhow.  
## 14.5. Which ports are required?<!-- omit in toc -->
For communication with the user's own Active Directory forest, trusted domains, and their sub-domains, the following ports are usually required:
- 88 TCP/UDP (Kerberos authentication)
- 389 TCP/UPD (LDAP)
- 636 TCP (LDAPS)
- 3268 TCP (Global Catalog)
- 3269 TCP (Global Catalog TLS)
- 49152-65535 TCP (high ports)

The client needs the following ports to access a SMB file share on a Windows server (see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc731402(v=ws.11)" target="_blank">this Microsoft article</a> for details):
- 137 UDP
- 138 UDP
- 139 TCP
- 445 TCP

The client needs port 443 TCP to access a SharePoint document library. When not using SharePoint Online with Graph, firewalls and proxies must not block WebDAV HTTP extensions.  
## 14.6. Why is out-of-office abbreviated OOF and not OOO?<!-- omit in toc -->
Back in the 1980s, Microsoft had a UNIX OS named Xenix … but read yourself <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/why-is-oof-an-oof-and-not-an-ooo/ba-p/610191" target="_blank">here</a>.  
## 14.7. Should I use .docx or .htm as file format for templates? Signatures in Outlook sometimes look different than my templates.<!-- omit in toc -->
The software uses DOCX as default template format, as this is the easiest way to delegate the creation and management of templates to departments such as Marketing or Corporate Communications:  
- Not all Word formatting options are supported in HTML, which can lead to signatures looking a bit different than templates. For example:
  - Images may be placed at a different position in the signature compared to the template - this is because the Outlook HTML component only supports the "in line with text" text wrapping option, while Word offers more options.
  - When using a text style from the Word Styles Gallery, you still may want to set the font and it's properties. Else, your fonts and formatting may adapt to identically named styles of the recipient. To avoid this, set the font manually, so that Word does not show "Calibri (Body)" or "Calibri (Heading)" in the font selection, but only "Calibri".
- On the other hand, the Outlook HTML renderer works better with templates in the DOCX format: The Outlook HTML renderer does not respect the HTML image tags "width" and "height" and displays all images in their original size. When using DOCX as template format, the images are resized when exported to the HTM format.
  
It is recommended to start with .docx as template format and to only use .htm when the template maintainers have really good HTML knowledge.

With the parameter `UseHtmTemplates`, the software searches for .htm template files instead of DOCX.

The requirements for .htm files these files are harder to fulfill as it is the case with DOCX files:  
- The template must have the file extension .htm, .html is not supported
- The template must be UTF-8 encoded (without BOM), or at least only contain UTF-8 compatible characters
- The character set must be set to UTF-8 with a meta tag: '`<meta http-equiv=Content-Type content="text/html; charset=utf-8">`'
- The template should be a single file, additional files and folders are not recommended (but possible, see below)
- Images can either reference a public URL, a relative local path (preferred) or be part of the template as Base64 encoded string
- When storing images in a relative local path:
  - Only one subfolder is allowed
  - The subfolder must be named '\<name of the HTM file without extension>\<suffix>'
    - The suffix must be one from the following list (as defined by Microsoft Office): '.files', '_archivos', '_arquivos', '_bestanden', '_bylos', '_datoteke', '_dosyalar', '_elemei', '_failid', '_fails', '_fajlovi', '_ficheiros', '_fichiers', '_file', '_files', '_fitxategiak', '_fitxers', '_pliki', '_soubory', '_tiedostot', '-Dateien', '-filer'
  - Example: The file 'My signature.htm' has images in the subfolder 'My signature.files'
  
Possible approaches for fulfilling these requirements are:  
- Design the template in a HTML editor that supports all features required  
- Design the template in Outlook  
  - Paste it into Word and save it as `"Website, filtered"`. The `"filtered"` is important here, as any other web format will not work.  
  - Run the resulting file through a script that converts the Word output to a single UTF-8 encoded (without BOM) HTML file. Alternatively, but not recommended, you can copy the .htm file and the associated folder containing images and other HTML information into the template folder.

The sample templates delivered with this script represent all possible formats:  
- `.\sample templates\Out-of-Office DOCX` and `.\sample templates\Signatures DOCX` contain templates in the DOCX format  
- `.\templates\Out-of-Office HTML` and `.\sample templates\Signatures HTML` contain templates in HTML format.  
## 14.8. How can I log the software output?<!-- omit in toc -->
The software has a built-in logging option. Logs are saved in the folder '`$(Join-Path -Path ([Environment]::GetFolderPath([Environment+SpecialFolder]::LocalApplicationData)) -ChildPath '\Set-OutlookSignatures\Logs')`', the files follow the naming scheme '`$("Set-OutlookSignatures_Log_yyyyMMddTHHmmssffff.txt")`', and files older than 14 days are deleted with every run.

To centrally define for which users or computers verbose logging should be enabled, you can use the following simple approach:

```powershell
& '\\server\share\folder\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1' -verbose:$(([Environment]::UserName -iin @('UserA', 'UserB')) -or ([Environment]::MachineName -iin @('ComputerA', 'ComputerB')))
```

If you want your own additional logging, you can, for example, use PowerShell's `Start-Transcript` and `Stop-Transcript` commands to create a logging wrapper around Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1:

```powershell
Start-Transcript -Path 'c:\path\to\your\logfile.txt'

& '\\server\share\folder\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1' # Optionally add: -verbose:$(([Environment]::UserName -iin @('UserA', 'UserB')) -or ([Environment]::MachineName -iin @('ComputerA', 'ComputerB')))

Stop-Transcript
```

## 14.9. How can I get more script output for troubleshooting?<!-- omit in toc -->
Start the software with the '-verbose' parameter to get the maximum output for troubleshooting.


## 14.10. How can I start the software only when there is a connection to the Active Directory on-prem?<!-- omit in toc -->
Per default, Set-OutlookSignatures tries to get the required information from Active Directory. When no Active Directory server can be reached, the Graph API is used to get the required information from Entra ID.

To use only Entra ID, you set the '`GraphOnly`' parameter to '`true`'.

There is no direct way to disable the use of Entra ID, which can result in users complaining about pop-up windows regarding authentication because no Entra ID app has been set-up yet. This can also be required when Set-OutlookSignatures is run every time a VPN connection is established, but the client firewall is too slow opening the required ports.

With the following code, you can make sure that Set-OutlookSignatures is only run when a connection to Active Directory is available:

```powershell
# Only run Set-OutlookSignatures when there is a connection to a Domain Controller.
# Covers the following cases:
#   - At least one DC from the users domain is pingable
#   - At least one Global Catalog server from the users domain is reachable via a GC query
#   - The querying user exists and is not locked

$testIntervalSeconds = 5 # Interval between retries
$testTimeoutSeconds = 120 # For how long to retry (in seconds) before giving up


Write-Host 'Start AD connectivity test'

Add-Type -AssemblyName System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement
$testCurrentUserDN = ([System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.UserPrincipal]::Current).DistinguishedName

if (
    $($null -eq $testCurrentUserDN) -or
    $(($testUserCurrentDN -split ',DC=').Count -lt 3)
) {
    Write-Host '  User is not a member of a domain, do not go on with further tests.'
} else {
    $testStartTime = Get-Date
    $testSuccess = $false

    do {
        if (Test-Connection $(($testCurrentUserDN -split ',DC=')[1..999] -join '.') -Count 1 -Quiet) {
            Write-Host '  User on-prem AD can be reached, perform test query against AD.'

            $testCurrentUserADProps = $null

            try {
                $testSearch = New-Object DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher
                $testSearch.PageSize = 1000
                $testSearch.SearchRoot = "GC://$(($testCurrentUserDN -split ',DC=')[1..999] -join '.')"
                $testSearch.Filter = "((distinguishedname=$($testCurrentUserDN)))"

                $testCurrentUserADProps = $testSearch.FindOne().Properties
            } catch {
                $testCurrentUserADProps = $null
            }

            if ($null -ne $testCurrentUserADProps) {
                Write-Host '  AD query was successful, user is not locked, DC is reachable via GC query: Start Set-OutlookSignatures.'

                $testSuccess = $true

                # Start Set-OutlookSignatures here
            } else {
                Write-Host '  AD query failed, user might be locked or DCs can not be reached via GC query: Do not start Set-OutlookSignatures.'
            }

        } else {
            Write-Host '  User on-prem AD can not be reached, do not go on with further tests.'
        }

        if ($testSuccess -ne $true) {
            $testElapsedSeconds = [math]::Ceiling((New-TimeSpan -Start $testStartTime).TotalSeconds)

            if ($testElapsedSeconds -ge $testTimeoutSeconds) {
                Write-Host "  Timeout reached ($($testTimeoutSeconds) seconds). Tests stopped."
                break
            } else {
                Write-Host "  Retrying in $($testIntervalSeconds) seconds. $($testTimeoutSeconds - $testElapsedSeconds) seconds left until timeout."
                Start-Sleep -Seconds $testIntervalSeconds
            }
        }
    } while ($testSuccess -ne $true)
}
```


## 14.11. Can multiple script instances run in parallel?<!-- omit in toc -->
The software is designed for being run in multiple instances at the same. You can combine any of the following scenarios:  
- One user runs multiple instances of the software in parallel  
- One user runs multiple instances of the software in simulation mode in parallel  
- Multiple users on the same machine (e.g. Terminal Server) run multiple instances of the software in parallel  

Please see `.\sample code\SimulateAndDeploy.ps1` for an example how to run multiple instances of Set-OutlookSignatures in parallel in a controlled manner. Don't forget to adapt path names and variables to your environment.
## 14.12. How do I start the software from the command line or a scheduled task?<!-- omit in toc -->
Passing arguments to PowerShell.exe from the command line or task scheduler can be very tricky when spaces are involved. You have to be very careful about when to use single quotes or double quotes.

A working example:

```batch
PowerShell.exe -Command "& '\\server\share\directory\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1' -SignatureTemplatePath '\\server\share\directory\templates\Signatures DOCX' -OOFTemplatePath '\\server\share\directory\templates\Out-of-Office DOCX' -ReplacementVariableConfigFile '\\server\share\directory\config\default replacement variables.ps1'"
```

You will find lots of information about this topic on the internet. The following links provide a first starting point:  
- <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45760457/how-can-i-run-a-powershell-script-with-white-spaces-in-the-path-from-the-command" target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45760457/how-can-i-run-a-powershell-script-with-white-spaces-in-the-path-from-the-command</a>
- <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28311191/how-do-i-pass-in-a-string-with-spaces-into-powershell" target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28311191/how-do-i-pass-in-a-string-with-spaces-into-powershell</a>
- <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10542313/powershell-and-schtask-with-task-that-has-a-space" target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10542313/powershell-and-schtask-with-task-that-has-a-space</a>
  
If you have to use the PowerShell.exe `-Command` or `-File` parameter depends on details of your configuration, for example AppLocker in combination with PowerShell. You may also want to consider the `-EncodedCommand` parameter to start Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 and pass parameters to it.
  
If you provided your users a link so they can start Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1 with the correct parameters on their own, you may want to use the official icon: `.\logo\Set-OutlookSignatures Icon.ico`

Please see `.\sample code\Set-OutlookSignatures.cmd` for an example. Don't forget to adapt path names to your environment.
### 14.12.1. Start Set-OutlookSignatures in hidden/invisible mode<!-- omit in toc -->
Even when the `hidden` parameter is passed to PowerShell, a window is created and minimized. Although this only takes some tenths of a second, it is not only optically disturbing, but the new window may also steal the keyboard focus.

The only workaround is to start PowerShell from another program, which does not need an own console window. Some examples for such programs are:
- Rob van der Woude's [RunNHide](https://www.robvanderwoude.com/csharpexamples.php#RunNHide)
- NTWind Software's [HStart](https://www.ntwind.com/software/hstart.html)
- wenshui2008's [RunHiddenConsole](https://github.com/wenshui2008/RunHiddenConsole)
- stax76's [run-hidden](https://github.com/stax76/run-hidden)
- Nir Sofer's [NirCmd](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html)
- As Microsoft has marked Visual Basic Script (VBS) as deprecated and will remove it completely from future Windows releases, the use of Windows Script Host (WSH) is not recommended. If you want to try it anyway, here is a working example:
  - Create a .vbs (Visual Basic Script) file, paste and adapt the following code into it:

    ```vbs
    command = "PowerShell.exe -Command ""& '\\server\share\directory\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1' -SignatureTemplatePath '\\server\share\directory\templates\Signatures DOCX' -OOFTemplatePath '\\server\share\directory\templates\Out-of-Office DOCX' -ReplacementVariableConfigFile '\\server\share\directory\config\default replacement variables.ps1'"" "

    set shell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")

    shell.Run command, 0
    ```

  - Then, run the .vbs file directly, without specifying cscript.exe as host (just execute `start.vbs` or `wscript.exe start.vbs`, but not `cscript.exe start.vbs`).
- If your Windows installation comes with the '`conhost.exe`' console host, you may want to try one of its undocumented parameters:

  ```batch
  conhost.exe --headless powershell.exe -File "\\server\share\directory\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1" -SignatureTemplatePath "\\server\share\directory\templates\Signatures DOCX" -OOFTemplatePath "\\server\share\directory\templates\Out-of-Office DOCX" -ReplacementVariableConfigFile "\\server\share\directory\config\default replacement variables.ps1"
  ```

## 14.13. How to create a shortcut to the software with parameters?<!-- omit in toc -->
You may want to provide a link on the desktop or in the start menu, so they can start the software on their own.

The Windows user interface does not allow you to create a shortcut with a combined length of full target path and arguments greater than 259 characters.

You can overcome this user interface limitation by using PowerShell to create a shortcut (.lnk file). See '`.\sample code\Create-DesktopIcon.ps1`' for a cross-platform example.

**Attention**: When editing the shortcut created with the code above in the Windows user interface, the command to be executed is shortened to 259 characters without further notice. This already happens when just opening the properties of the created .lnk file, changing nothing and clicking OK.

See `.\sample code\CreateDesktopIcon.ps1` for a code example. Don't forget to adapt path names to your environment. 
## 14.14. What is the recommended approach for implementing the software?<!-- omit in toc -->
The Quick Start Guide in this document is a good overall starting point for beginners.

For the organizational aspects around Set-OutlookSignatures, read the "Implementation Approach" document. The content is based on real life experiences implementing the software in multi-client environments with a five-digit number of mailboxes.

It contains proven procedures and recommendations for product managers, architects, operations managers, account managers and email and client administrators. It is suited for service providers as well as for clients.

It covers several general overview topics, administration, support, training across the whole lifecycle from counselling to tests, pilot operation and rollout up to daily business.

The document is available in English and German language.  
## 14.15. What is the recommended approach for custom configuration files?<!-- omit in toc -->
You should not change the default configuration files `.\config\default replacement variable.ps1` and `.\config\default graph config.ps1`, as they might be changed in a future release of Set-OutlookSignatures. In this case, you would have to sort out the changes yourself.

The following steps are recommended:
1. Create a new custom configuration file in a separate folder.
2. The first step in the new custom configuration file should be to load the default configuration file, `.\config\default replacement variable.ps1` in this example:

   ```powershell
   # Loading default replacement variables shipped with Set-OutlookSignatures
   . ([System.Management.Automation.ScriptBlock]::Create((Get-Content -LiteralPath $(Join-Path -Path $(Get-Location).ProviderPath -ChildPath '\config\default replacement variables.ps1') -Raw)))
   ```

3. After importing the default configuration file, existing replacement variables can be altered with custom definitions and new replacement variables can be added.
4. Start Set-OutlookSignatures with the parameter `ReplacementVariableConfigFile` pointing to the new custom configuration file.
## 14.16. Isn't a plural noun in the software name against PowerShell best practices?<!-- omit in toc -->
Absolutely. PowerShell best practices recommend using singular nouns, but Set-OutlookSignatures contains a plural noun.

We intentionally decided not to follow the singular noun convention, as another language as PowerShell was initially used for coding and the name of the tool was already defined. If this was a commercial enterprise project, marketing would have overruled development.
## 14.17. The software hangs at HTM/RTF export, Word shows a security warning!?<!-- omit in toc -->
When using a signature template with account pictures (linked and embedded), conversion to HTM hangs at "Export to HTM format" or "Export to RTF format". In the background, there is a window "Microsoft Word Security Notice" with the following text:

> Microsoft Office has identified a potential security concern.

The message seems to come from a new security feature of Word versions published around August 2021. You will find several discussions regarding the message in internet forums, but we are not aware of any official statement from Microsoft.

The behavior can be changed in at least two ways:
- Group Policy: Enable "User Configuration\Administrative Templates\Microsoft Word 2016\Word Options\Security\Don’t ask permission before updating IncludePicture and IncludeText fields in Word"
- Registry: Set "HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Word\Security\DisableWarningOnIncludeFieldsUpdate" (DWORD_32) to 1

Set-OutlookSignatures reads the registry key `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\<current Word version>\Word\Security\DisableWarningOnIncludeFieldsUpdate` at start, sets it to 1 just before a conversion to HTM or RTF takes place and restores the original state as soon as the conversion is finished.

This way, the warning usually gets suppressed.

Be aware that this does not work when the setting is configured via group policies, as group policy settings are prioritized over user configured settings.
## 14.18. How to avoid blank lines when replacement variables return an empty string?<!-- omit in toc -->
Not all users have values for all attributes, e. g. a mobile number. These empty attributes can lead to blank lines in signatures, which may not look nice.

Follow these steps to avoid blank lines:
1. Use a custom replacement variable config file.
2. Modify the value of all attributes that should not leave an blank line when there is no text to show:
    - When the attribute is empty, return an empty string
    - Else, return a newline (`Shift+Enter` in Word, `` `n `` in PowerShell, `<br>` in HTML) or a paragraph mark (`Enter` in Word, `` `r`n `` in PowerShell, `<p>` in HTML), and then the attribute value.  
3. Place all required replacement variables on a single line, without a space between them. The replacement variables themselves contain the required newline or paragraph marks.
4. Use the ReplacementVariableConfigFile parameter when running the software.

Be aware that text replacement also happens in hyperlinks (`tel:`, `mailto:` etc.).  
Instead of altering existing replacement variables, it is recommended to create new replacement variables with modified content.  
Use the new one for the pure textual replacement (including the newline), and the original one for the replacement within the hyperlink.  

The following example describes optional preceeding text combined with an optional replacement variable containing a hyperlink.  
The internal variable `$UseHtmTemplates` is used to automatically differentiate between DOCX and HTM line breaks.
- Custom replacement variable config file

  ```powershell
  $ReplaceHash['$CurrentUserTelephone-prefix-noempty$'] = $(if (-not $ReplaceHash['$CurrentUserTelephone$']) { '' } else { $(if ($UseHtmTemplates) { '<br>' } else { "`n" }) + 'Telephone: ' } )
  
  $ReplaceHash['$CurrentUserMobile-prefix-noempty$'] = $(if (-not $ReplaceHash['$CurrentUserMobile$']) { '' } else { $(if ($UseHtmTemplates) { '<br>' } else { "`n" }) + 'Mobile: ' } )
  ```

- Word template:  
  <pre><code>email: <a href="mailto:$CurrentUserMail$">$CurrentUserMail$</a>$CurrentUserTelephone-prefix-noempty$<a href="tel:$CurrentUserTelephone$">$CurrentUserTelephone$</a>$CurrentUserMobile-prefix-noempty$<a href="tel:$CurrentUserMobile$">$CurrentUserMobile$</a></code></pre>

  Note that all variables are written on one line and that not only `$CurrentUserMail$` is configured with a hyperlink, but `$CurrentUserPhone$` and `$CurrentUserMobile$` too:
  - `mailto:$CurrentUserMail$`
  - `tel:$CurrentUserTelephone$`
  - `tel:$CurrentUserMobile$`
- Results
  - Telephone number and mobile number are set.  
  The paragraph marks come from `$CurrentUserTelephone-prefix-noempty$` and `$CurrentUserMobile-prefix-noempty$`.  
    <pre><code>email: <a href="mailto:first.last@example.com">first.last@example.com</a>
    Telephone: <a href="tel:+43xxx">+43xxx</a>
    Mobile: <a href="tel:+43yyy">+43yyy</a></code></pre>
  - Telephone number is set, mobile number is empty.  
  The paragraph mark comes from `$CurrentUserTelephone-prefix-noempty$`.  
    <pre><code>email: <a href="mailto:first.last@example.com">first.last@example.com</a>
    Telephone: <a href="tel:+43xxx">+43xxx</a></code></pre>
  - Telephone number is empty, mobile number is set.  
  The paragraph mark comes from `$CurrentUserMobile-prefix-noempty$`.  
    <pre><code>email: <a href="mailto:first.last@example.com">first.last@example.com</a>
    Mobile: <a href="tel:+43yyy">+43yyy</a></code></pre>
## 14.19. Is there a roadmap for future versions?<!-- omit in toc -->
There is no binding roadmap for future versions, although we maintain a list of ideas in the 'Contribution opportunities' chapter of '.\docs\CONTRIBUTING'.

Fixing issues has priority over new features, of course.
## 14.20. How to deploy signatures for "Send As", "Send On Behalf" etc.?<!-- omit in toc -->
The software only considers primary mailboxes, these are mailboxes added as separate accounts. This is the same way Outlook handles mailboxes from a signature perspective: Outlook cannot handle signatures for non-primary mailboxes (added via "Open these additional mailboxes").

If you want to deploy signatures for non-primary mailboxes, set the parameter `SignaturesForAutomappedAndAdditionalMailboxes` to `true` to allow the software to detect automapped and additional mailboxes. Signatures can be deployed for these types of mailboxes, but they cannot be set as default signatures due to technical restrictions in Outlook.

If you want to deploy signatures for
- mailboxes you don't add to Outlook but just use an assigned "Send As" or "Send on Behalf" right by choosing a different "From" address,
- distribution lists, for which you use an assigned "Send As" or "Send on Behalf" right by choosing a different "From" address,
create a group specific signature, where the group does not refer to the mailbox or distribution group the email is sent from, but rather the user or group who has the right to send from this mailbox or distribution group.

An example:
Members of the group "Example\Group" have the right to send as mailbox m<area>@example.com and as the distribution group dg<area>@example.com.

You want to deploy signatures for the mailbox m<area>@example.com and the distribution group dg<area>@example.com.

Problem 1: dg<area>@example.com can't be added as a mailbox to Outlook, as it is a distribution group.

Problem 2: The mailbox m<area>@example.com is configured as non-primary maibox on most clients, because most of the users have the "Send as" permission, but not the "Full Access" permissions. Some users even don't connect the mailbox at all, they just choose m<area>@example.com as "From" address.

**Solution option A**  
Create signature templates for the mailbox m<area>@example.com and the distribution group dg<area>@example.com and **assign them to the group that has been granted the "send as" permission**:

```ini
[External English formal m@example.com.docx]
Example Group

[External English formal dg@example.com.docx]
Example Group
```

This works as long as the personal mailbox of a member of "Example\Group" is connected in Outlook as primary mailbox (which usually is the case). When this personal mailbox is processed by Set-OutlookSignatures, the software recognizes the group membership and the signature assigned to it.

Caveat: The `$CurrentMailbox[…]$` replacement variables refer to the user's personal mailbox in this case, not to m<area>@example.com.

**Solution option B**  
This option only works for mailboxes not for distribution groups.

Create signature templates for the mailbox m<area>@example.com and **assign them to m<area>@example.com**. Use the virtual mailbox feature of the Benefactor Circle add-on to make sure that m<area>@example.com is always treated as if it were added to Outlook, not matter if it has been added or not (see '`VirtualMailboxConfigFile`' in this document for details).

```ini
[External English formal SendAs m@example.com.docx]
m@example.com
# Do not deploy the signature if m@example.com is the personal mailbox of the logged-on user
-CURRENTUSER:m@example.com
```

You can now use replacement variables of both the `$CurrentUser[…]$` and the `$CurrentMailbox[…]$` namespace.

Hint: You can also use the VirtualMailboxConfigFile to dynamically define signature INI file entries. See '`VirtualMailboxConfigFile`' in this document for details.
## 14.21. Can I centrally manage and deploy Outook stationery with this script?<!-- omit in toc -->
Outlook stationery describes the layout of emails, including font size and color for new emails and for replies and forwards.

The default email font, size and color are usually an integral part of corporate design and corporate identity. CI/CD typically also defines the content and layout of signatures.

Set-OutlookSignatures has no features regarding deploying Outlook stationery, as there are better ways for doing this.  
Outlook stores stationery settings in `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\<Version>\Common\MailSettings`. You can use a logon script or group policies to deploy these keys, on-prem and for managed devices in the cloud.  
Unfortunately, Microsoft's group policy templates (ADMX files) for Office do not seem to provide detailed settings for Outlook stationery, so you will have to deploy registry keys. 
## 14.22. Why is dynamic group membership not considered on premises?<!-- omit in toc -->
Membership in dynamic groups, no matter if they are of the security or distribution type, is considered only when using Microsoft Graph.

Dynamic group membership is not considered when using an on premises Active Directory. 

The reason for this is that Graph and on-prem AD handle dynamic group membership differently:
### 14.22.1. Entra ID<!-- omit in toc -->
Entra ID caches information about dynamic group membership at the group as well as at the user level. It regularly runs the LDAP queries defining dynamic groups and updates existing attributes with member information.

Dynamic groups in Entra ID are therefore not strictly dynamic in terms of running the defining LDAP query every time a dynamic group is used and thus providing near real-time member information - they behave more like regularly updated static groups, which makes handling for scripts and applications much easier.

For the use in Set-OutlookSignatures, there is no difference between a static and a dynamic group in Entra ID:
- Querying the `transitiveMemberOf` attribute of a user returns static as well as dynamic group membership.
- Querying the `members` attribute of a group returns the group's members, no matter if the group is static or dynamic.
### 14.22.2. Active Directory on premises<!-- omit in toc -->
Active Directory on premises does not cache any information about membership in dynamic groups at the user level, so dynamic groups do not appear in attributes such as `memberOf` and `tokenGroups`.

Active Directory on premises also does not cache any information about members of dynamic groups at the group level, so the group attribute `members` is always empty.

If dynamic groups would have to be considered, the only way would be to enumerate all dynamic groups, to run the LDAP query that defines each group, and to finally evaluate the resulting group membership.  
The LDAP queries defining dynamic groups are deemed expensive due to the potential load they put on Active Directory and their resulting runtime.  
Microsoft does not recommend against dynamic groups on-prem, only not to use them heavily.  
This is very likely the reason why dynamic groups cannot be granted permissions on Exchange mailboxes and other Exchange objects, and why each dynamic group can be assigned an expansion server executing the LDAP query (expansion times of 15 minutes or more are not rare in the field).

Taking all these aspects into account, Set-OutlookSignatures will not consider membership in dynamic groups on premises until a reliable and efficient way of querying a user's dynamic group membership is available.

A possible way around this restriction is replacing dynamic groups with regularly updated static groups (which is what Entra ID does automatically in the background):
- An Identity Management System (IDM) or a script regularly executes the LDAP query, which would otherwise define a dynamic group, and updates the member list of a static group.
- These updates usually happen less frequent than a dynamic group is used. The static group might not be fully up-to-date when used, but other aspects outweigh this disadvantage most of the time:
  - Reduced load on Active Directory (partially transferred to IDM system or server running a script)
  - Static groups can be used for permissions
  - Changes in static group membership can be documented more easily
  - Static groups can be expanded to it's members in email clients
  - Membership in static groups can easily be queried
  - Overcoming query parameter restrictions, such as combining the results of multiple LDAP queries
## 14.23. Why is no admin or user GUI available?<!-- omit in toc -->
From an admin perspective, Set-OutlookSignatures has been designed to work with on-board tools wherever possible and to make managing and deploying signatures intuitive.

This "easy to set up, easy to understand, easy to maintain" approach is why
- there is no need for a dedicated server, a database or a setup program
- Word documents are supported as templates in addition to HTML templates
- there is the clear hierarchy of common, group specific and email address specific template application order

For an admin, the most complicated part is bringing Set-OutlookSignatures to his users by integrating it into the logon script, deploy a desktop icon or start menu entry, or creating a scheduled task. Alternatively, an admin can use a signature deployment method without user or client involvement.  
Both tasks are usually neccessary only once, sample code and documentation based on real life experiences are available.  
Anyhow, a basic GUI for configuring the software is accessible via the following built-in PowerShell command:

```powershell
Show-Command '.\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1'
```

For a template creator/maintainer, maintaining the INI files defining template application order and permissions is the main task, in combination with tests using simulation mode.  
These tasks typically happen multiple times a year. A graphical user interface might make them more intuitive and easier; until then, documentation and examples based on real life experiences are available.

From an end user perspective, Set-OutlookSignatures should not have a GUI at all. It should run in the background or on demand, but there should be no need for any user interaction.

## 14.24. What if a user has no Outlook profile or is prohibited from starting Outlook?<!-- omit in toc -->
Mailboxes are taken from the first matching source:
  1. Simulation mode is enabled: Mailboxes defined in SimulateMailboxes
  2. Outlook is installed and has profiles, and New Outlook is not set as default: Mailboxes from Outlook profiles
  3. New Outlook is installed: Mailboxes from New Outlook (including manually added and automapped mailboxes for the currently logged-in user)
  4. If none of the above matches: Mailboxes from Outlook Web (including manually added mailboxes, automapped mailboxes follow when Microsoft updates Outlook Web to match the New Outlook experience)

Default signatures cannot be set locally or in Outlook Web until an Outlook profile has been configured, as the corresponding settings are stored in registry paths containing random numbers, which need to be created by Outlook.
## 14.25. What if Outlook is not installed at all?<!-- omit in toc -->
If Outlook is not installed at all, Set-OutlookSignatures will still be useful: It determine the logged-in users email address, create the signatures for his personal mailbox in a temporary location, set a default signature in Outlook Web as well as the out-of-office replies.
## 14.26. What about the roaming signatures feature in Exchange Online?<!-- omit in toc -->
Set-OutlookSignatures can handle roaming signatures since v4.0.0. See `MirrorCloudSignatures` in this document for details.

Set-OutlookSignatures supports romaing signatures independent from the Outlook version used. Roaming signatures are also supported in scenarios where only Outlook Web in the cloud or New Outlook is used.

As there is no Microsoft official API yet, this feature is to be used at your own risk.

Storing signatures in the mailbox is a good idea, as this makes signatures available across devices and apps.

As soon as Microsoft makes available a public API, more email clients will get support for this feature - which will close a gap, Set-OutlookSignatures cannot fill because it is not running on exchange servers: Adding signatures to mails sent from apss besides Outlook for Windows, Outlook Web and New Outlook.

Roaming signatures will very likely never be available for mailboxes on-prem, and it seems that it also will not be available for shared mailboxes in the cloud.

Until an API is available, you can disable the feature with a registry key - you can still use the feature via Set-OutlookSignatures. This key forces Outlook for Windows to use the well-known file based approach and ensure full compatibility with Set-OutlookSignatures, until a public API is released and incorporated into the software. For details, please see <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/outlook-roaming-signatures-420c2995-1f57-4291-9004-8f6f97c54d15?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us" target="_blank">this Microsoft article</a>.

Microsoft is already supporting the feature in Outlook Web for more and more Exchange Online tenants. Currently, this breaks PowerShell commands such as Set-MailboxMessageConfiguration. If you want to temporarily disable the feature for Outlook Web in your Exchange Online, you can do this with the command `Set-OrganizationConfig -PostponeRoamingSignaturesUntilLater $false`.
## 14.27. Why does the text color of my signature change sometimes?<!-- omit in toc -->
Set-OutlookSignatures does not change text color. Very likely, your template files and your Outlook installation are configured for this color change:
- Per default, Outlook uses black text for new emails, and blue text for replies and forwarded emails
- Word and the signature editor integrated in Outlook have a specific color named "Automatic"

When using DOCX templates with parts of the text formatted in the "Automatic" color, Outlook changes the color of these parts to black for new emails, and to blue for replies and forwards.

This behavior is very often wanted, so that the greeting formula, which usually is part of the signature, has the same color as the preceding text of the email.

The default colors can be configured in Outlook.  
Outlook seems to have problems with this in certain patch levels when creating a reply in the preview pane, popping out the draft to it's own window and then switching to another signature.
## 14.28. How to make Set-OutlookSignatures work with Microsoft Purview Information Protection?<!-- omit in toc -->
Set-OutlookSignatures does work well with Microsoft Purview Information Protection, when configured correctly.

If you do not enforce setting sensitivity labels or exclude DOCX and RTF file formats, no further actions are required.

If you enforce setting sensitivity labels:
- When using DOCX templates, just set the desired sensitivity label on all your template files.
  - It is recommended to use a label without encryption or watermarks, often named 'General' or 'Public':
    - Outlook signatures and out-of-office replies usually only contain information which is intended to be shared publicly by design.
    - The templates themselves usually do not contain sensitive data, only placeholder variables.
    - Documents labeled this way can be opened without having the Information Protection Add-In for Office installed. This is useful when not all of your Set-OutlookSignatures users are also Information Protection users and have the Add-In installed.
  - When using a template with an other sensitivity label, every client Set-OutlookSignatures runs on needs the Information Protection Add-In for Office installed, and the user running Set-OutlookSignatures needs permission to access the protected file.
  - The RTF signature file will be created with the same sensitivity label as the template. This is only relevant for the user composing a new email in RTF format, as the composing user needs to be able to open the RTF document and copy the content from it - the actual signature in the email does not have Information Protection applied.
  - The .HTM and .TXT signature files will be created without a sensitivity label, as these documents cannot be protected by Microsoft Information Protection.
  - If you do not set a sensitivity label, Word will prompt the user to choose one each time the unlabeled local copy of a template is converted to .htm, .rtf or .txt.
    - The DOCX sample template files that come with Set-OutlookSignatures do not have a sensitivity label set.
- When using HTM templates, no further actions are required.
  - HTM files cannot be assigned a sensitivity label, and converting HTM files to RTF is possible even when sensitivity labels are enforced.
  - Converting HTM files to TXT is also no problem, as both file formats cannot be assigned a sensitivity label. 

Additional information that might be of interest for your Information Protection configuration:
- Template files are copied to the local temp directory of the user (PowerShell: `[System.IO.Path]::GetTempPath()`) for further use, with a randomly generated GUID as name. The extension is the one of the template (.docx or .htm).
- The local copy of a template file is opened for variable replacement, saved back to disk, and then re-opened for each file conversion (to .htm if neccessary, and optionally to .rtf and/or .txt). 
- Converted files are also stored in the temp directory, using the same GUID as the original file as file name but a different file extension (.htm, .rtf, .txt).
- After all variable replacements and conversions are completed for a template, the converted files (HTM mandatory, RTF and TXT optional) are copied to the Outlook signature folder. The path of this folder is language and version dependent (Registry: `HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Office\<Outlook Version>\Common\General\Signatures`).
- All temporary files mentioned are deleted by Set-OutlookSignatures as part of the clean-up process.
## 14.29. Images in signatures have a different size than in templates, or a black background<!-- omit in toc -->
The size of images in signatures may differ to the size of the very same image in a template. This may have observable in several ways:
- Images are already displayed too big or too small when composing a message. Not all signatures with images need to be affected, and the problem does not need to be bound to specific users or client computers.
- Images are displayed correctly when composing and sending an email, but are shown in different sizes at the recipient.

In both cases, usually only emails composed HTML format are affected, but not emails in RTF format.

When only the recipient is affected, it is very likely that the problem is to be found within the email client of the recipient, as it very likely does not respect or interpret HTML width and height attributes correctly.  
- This problem cannot be solved on the sending side, only on the recipient side. But the sender side can implement a workaround: Do not scale images in templates (by resizing them in Word or using HTML width and height tags), but use the original size of the image. It may be neccessary to resize the images with tools like GIMP before using them in templates.

When the problem can already be seen when composing a message, there may be different root causes and according solutions or workarounds.

To find the root cause:
- Use the same signature template to create individual signatures for all the following steps.
- Find out if the problem is user or computer related. Let affected users log on to non-affected computer, and vice versa, to test this.
- Find out if only Outlook displays the image in the wrong size. Open the signature HTM file in Word, Chrome, Edge and Firefox for comparison.
- Copy the affected HTM signature file (the signature, not the template) and let a non-affected user use it in Outlook to see if the problem exists there, too.
- Compare the 'img' tag between the signature (from the same template) of an affected and a non-affected user. If they are identical, the root cause is not the generated HTML code, but it's interpretation and display in Outlook (therefore, the problem can't be in Set-OutlookSignatures).
- Collect the following data for a number of affected and non-affected users and computer to help you find the root cause:
  - User name
  - Computer name
  - Windows version including build number
  - Word version including build number
  - Outlook version including build number
  - Does Chrome display the image in the correct size?
  - Does Edge display the image in the correct size?
  - Does Firefox display the image in the correct size?
  - Does Outlook display the image in the correct size?
  - Does Word display the image in the correct size?

Two workarounds are available when you do not want to or can't find and solve the root cause of the problem:
- Do not scale images in templates (by resizing them in Word, or using HTML width and height attributes), but use the original size of the image. It may be neccessary to resize the images with tools like GIMP before using them in templates.
- The problem may only appear when templates are converted to signatures on computers configured with a display scaling higher than 100 %. In this case, the problem is in the Word conversion module or the HTML rendering engine of Word (which is used by Outlook). The registry key described in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/outlook/troubleshoot/user-interface/graphics-file-attachment-grows-larger-in-recipient-email" target="_blank">this Microsoft article</a> may help here. After setting the registry key according to the article, Outlook and Word need to be restarted and Set-OutlookSignatures needs to run again.  
Starting with v4.0.0, Set-OutlookSignatures sets the `DontUseScreenDpiOnOpen` registry key to the recommended value. 

Nonetheless, some scaling and display problems simply cannot be solved in the HTML code of the signature, because the problem is in the Word HRML rendering engine used by Outlook: For example, some Word builds ignore embedded image width and height attributes and always scale these images at 100% size, or sometimes display them with inverted colors or a black background.  
In this case, you can influence how images are displayed and converted from DOCX to HTM with the parameters `EmbedImagesInHtml` and `DocxHighResImageConversion`:

The parameter `MoveCSSInline` may also influence how signatures are displayed. Not all clients support the same set of CSS features, and there are clients not or not fully supporting CSS classes.  
The Word HTML rendering engine used by Outlook is rather conservative regarding CSS support, which is good from a sender perspective.  
When the `MoveCSSInline` parameter is enabled, which it is by default, cross-client compatibility is even more enhanced: All the formatting defined in CSS classes is intellegently moved to inline CSS formatting, which supported by a higher number of clients. This is a best practive in email marketing.
## 14.30. How do I alternate banners and other images in signatures?<!-- omit in toc -->
Let's say, your marketing campaign has three different banners to avoid viewer fatigue. It will be very hard to instruct your users to regularly rotate between these banners in signatures.

You can automate this with Set-OutlookSignatures in two simple steps:
1. Create a customer replacement variable for each banner and randomly only assign one of these variables a value:

    ```powershell
    $tempBannerIdentifiers = @(1, 2, 3)

    $tempBannerIdentifiers | Foreach-Object {
        $ReplaceHash["CurrentMailbox_Banner$($_)"] = $null
    }

    $ReplaceHash["CurrentMailbox_Banner$($tempBannerIdentifiers | Get-Random)"] = $true

    Remove-Variable -Name 'tempBannerIdentifiers'
    ```

2. Add all three banners to your template and define an alternate text  
Use `$CurrentMailbox_Banner1DELETEEMPTY$` for banner 1, `$CurrentMailbox_Banner2DELETEEMPTY$` for banner 2, and so on.  
The DELETEEMPTY part deletes an image when the corresponding replacement variable does not contain a value.

Now, with every run of Set-OutlookSignatures, a different random banner from the template is chosen and the other banners are deleted.


You can enhance this even further:
- Use banner 1 twice as often as the others. Just add it to the code multiple times:

  ```powershell
  $tempBannerIdentifiers = @(1, 1, 2, 3)
  ```

- Assign banners to specific users, departments, locations or any other attribute
- Restrict banner usage by date or season
- You could assign banners based on your share price or expected weather queried from a web service
- And much more, including any combination of the above
## 14.31. How can I deploy and run Set-OutlookSignatures using Microsoft Intune?<!-- omit in toc -->
There are multiple ways to integrate Set-OutlookSignatures in Intune, depending on your configuration.

When not using an Always On VPN, place your configuration and template files in a SharePoint document library that can be accessed from the internet.
### 14.31.1. Application package<!-- omit in toc -->
The classic way is to deploy an application package. You can use tools such as [IntuneWin32App](https://github.com/MSEndpointMgr/IntuneWin32App) for this.

As Set-OutlookSignatures does not have a classic installer, you will have to create a small wrapper script that simulates an installer. You will have to update the package or create a new one with every new release you plan to use - just as with any other application you want to deploy.

Deployment is only the first step, as the software needs to be run regularly. You have multiple options for this: Let the user run it via a start menu entry or a desktop shortcut, use scheduled tasks, a background service, or a remediation script (which is probably the most convenient way to do it).
### 14.31.2. Remediation script<!-- omit in toc -->
With remediation, you have two scripts: One checking for a certain status, and another one running when the detection script exits with an error code of 1.

Remediation scripts can easily be configured to run in the context of the current user, which is required for Set-OutlookSignatures, and you can define how often they should run.

For Set-OutlookSignatures, you could use the following scripts, which do not require the creation and deployment of an application package as an additional benefit.

The detection script could look like the sample code '.\sample code\Intune-SetOutlookSignatures-Detect.ps1':
- Check for existence of a log file
- If the log file does not exist or is older than a defined number of hours, start the remediation script

The remediation script could look like the sample code '.\sample code\Intune-SetOutlookSignatures-Remediate.ps1':
- If Set-OutlookSignatures is not available locally in the defined version, download the defined version from GitHub
- Start Set-OutlookSignatures with defined parameters
- Log all actions to a file that the detection script can check at its next run
## 14.32. Why does Set-OutlookSignatures run slower sometimes?<!-- omit in toc -->
There are multiple factors influencing the execution speed of Set-OutlookSignatures.

Set-OutlookSignatures is written with efficiency in mind, reducing the number of operations where possible. Nonetheless, you may see huge differences when comparing processing times, even on the same client.

For example: Calling Set-OutlookSignatures with the same configuration, we have measured processing times varying from 27 to 113 seconds on the very same client. With longer runtimes, all individual steps require more time, whereby file system activities are usually particularly slow.

This is not because different code is being executed, but because of multiple factors outside of Set-OutlookSignatures. The most important ones are described below.

Please don't forget: Set-OutlookSignatures usually runs in the background, without the user even noticing it. From this point of view, processing times do not really matter - slow execution may even be wanted, as it consumes less resources which in turn are available for interactive applications used in the foreground.
### 14.32.1. Windows power mode<!-- omit in toc -->
Windows has power plans and, in newer versions, power modes. These can have a huge impact, as the following test result shows:
- Best power efficiency: 113 seconds
- Balanced: 32 seconds
- Best performance: 27 seconds
### 14.32.2. Malware protection<!-- omit in toc -->
Malware protection is an absolute must, but security typically comes with a drawback in terms of comfort: Malware protection costs performance.

We do not recommend to turn off malware protection, but to optimize it for your environment. Some examples:
- Place Set-OutlookSignatures and template files on a server share. When the files are scanned on the server, you may consider to exclude the server share from scanning on the client.
- Your anti-malware may have an option to not scan digitally signed files every time they are executed. Set-OutlookSignatures and its dependencies are digitally signed with an Extend Validation (EV) certificate for tamper protection and easy integration into locked-down environments. You can sign the executables with your own certificate, too.
### 14.32.3. Time of execution<!-- omit in toc -->
The time of execution can have a huge impact.
- Consider not running Set-OutlookSignatures right at logon, but maybe a bit later. Logon is resource intensive, as not only the user environment is created, but all sorts of automatisms kick off: Autostarting applications, file synchronisation, software updates, and so on.
- Consider not executing all tasks and scripts at the same time, but starting them in groups or one after the other.
- Set-OutlookSignatures relies on network connections. At times with higher network traffic, such as on a Monday morning with all users starting their computers and logging on within a rather short timespan, things may just be a bit slower.
- Do not run Set-OutlookSignatures for all your users at the same time. Instead of "Every two hours, starting at 08:00", use a more varied interval such as "Every two hours after logon".
### 14.32.4. Script and Word process priority<!-- omit in toc -->
As mentioned before, Set-OutlookSignatures usually runs in the background, without the user even noticing it.

From this point of view, processing times do not really matter - slow execution may even be wanted, as it consumes less resources which in turn are available for interactive applications used in the foreground.

You can define the process priority with the `ScriptProcessPriority` and `WordProcessPriority` priority.
## 14.33. Keep users from adding, editing and removing signatures<!-- omit in toc -->
### 14.33.1. Outlook<!-- omit in toc -->
You can disable GUI elements so that users cannot add, edit and remove signatures in Outlook by using the 'Do not allow signatures for email messages' Group Policy Object (GPO) setting.

Caveats are:
- Users can still add, edit and remove signatures in the file system
- Default signatures are no longer automatically added when a new email is created, or you forward/reply an email. Users have to choose the correct signature manually.
- The GPO setting seems not ot work with some newer versions of Outlook. In this case, set the registry key directly.

As an alternative, you may consider one or both of the following alternatives:
- Run Set-OutlookSignatures regularly (every two hours, for example) and use the 'WriteProtect' option in the INI file
- Use the 'Disable Items in User Interface' Group Policy Object (GPO) setting, and consider the following values to disable specific signature-related parts of the user interface:
  - 5608: 'SignatureInsertMenu', the dropdown list/button allowing you to select an existing signature to add to an email, and to open the 'SignatureGallery'.
  - 22965: 'SignatureGallyery', the list of signatures in the 'SignatureInsertMenu'. Prohibits selecting another signature than the default one to add to an email, but still allows access to 'SignaturesStationeryDialog'.
  - 3766: 'SignaturesStationeryDialog', the GUI allowing users to add, edit and remove signatures. Also disables access to 'Personal Stationary' and 'Stationary and Fonts' - these settings should be controlled centrally anyway in order to comply with the corporate identity/corporate design guidelines.

There is one thing you cannot disable: Outlook always allows users to edit the copy of the signature after it was added to an email.
### 14.33.2. Outlook Web<!-- omit in toc -->
Unfortunately, Outlook Web cannot be configured as granularly as Outlook. In Exchange Online as well as in Exchange on-prem, the `Set-OwaMailboxPolicy` cmdlet does not allow you to configure signature settings in detail, but only to disable or enable signature features`SignaturesEnabled` for specific groups of mailboxes.

There is no option to write protect signatures, or to keep users from from adding, editing and removing signatures without disabling all signature-related features.

As an alternative, run Set-OutlookSignatures regularly (every two hours, for example).
## 14.34. What is the recommended folder structure for script, license, template and config files?<!-- omit in toc -->
Choosing an unsuitable folder structure for script, license, template and config files can make it hard to upgrade to new versions.

The following structure is recommended, as it separates customized files from script and license files.
- **Root share folder**  
  For example, '\\\\server\share\folder'
  - **Config**  
    Contains your custom config files (custom Graph config file, custom replacement variable config file, maybe template INI files)
  - **License**  
    Contains the Benefactor Circle add-on
  - **Set-OutlookSignatures**  
    Contains Set-OutlookSignatures
  - **Templates**
    - **OOF**  
      Contains out-of-office templates, and the corresponding INI file (if not placed in 'Config' folder)
    - **Signatures**  
      Contains signature templates, and the corresponding INI file (if not placed in 'Config' folder)

When you want to upgrade to a new release, you basically just have to delete the content of the 'Set-OutlookSignatures' and 'Set-OutlookSignatures license' folders and copy the new files to them.

Never add new files to or modify existing files in the 'Set-OutlookSignatures' and 'Config' folders.

If you want to use a custom Graph config file or a custom replacement variable file, follow the instructions in the default files.

Alternative options for storing files:
-  Set-OutlookSignatures files do not need to be centrally hosted on a file server. You can write a script that downloads a specific version and keeps it on your clients. Search this document for 'Intune' to find a sample script doing this.
-  License, config and template files do not need to be stored on a file server. They can also be made available in a SharePoint document library.
-  Some clients do not use on-prem file servers, but use SMB file shares in Azure Files, as they can be made available from on-prem as well via internet.
## 14.35. How to disable the tagline in signatures?<!-- omit in toc -->
Set-OutlookSignatures adds a tagline to each signature deployed for mailboxes without a [Benefactor Circle](Benefactor%20Circle.md) license.

Signatures for mailboxes with a [Benefactor Circle](Benefactor%20Circle.md) license do not get this tagline appended.

Dear companies, please do not forget:
- Invest in the free and open-source software you depend on. Contributors are working behind the scenes to make open-source better for everyone. Give them the help and recognition they deserve.
- Sponsor the free and open-source software your teams use to keep your business running. Fund the projects that make up your software supply chain to improve its performance, reliability, and stability.

Being free and open-source software, Set-OutlookSignatures saves your company a remarkable amount of money compared to commercial software.

Become a Benefactor Circle member to unlock additional features: See [`.\docs\Benefactor Circle`](Benefactor%20Circle.md) or [`https://explicitonsulting.at`](https://explicitconsulting.at/open-source/set-outlooksignatures) for details about these features and their benefits for your business.

### Why the tagline?<!-- omit in toc -->
I initially created Set-OutlookSignatures to give back to the community by showing how to correctly script stuff that I have seen being done in wrong and incomplete ways over and over again:
- Efficient queries for nested Active Directory group membership,
- working with SID history,
- working with AD queries in the most complex environments and across trusts,
- parallel code execution in PowerShell,
- working with Graph,
- and - of course - a fresh approach on how to manage and deploy signatures for Outlook.

Since the free version of Set-OutlookSignatures has first been published in 2021, dozens of features have been added - quickly scroll through the CHANGELOG to get an idea of what I am talking about.<br>I invested more than a thousand hours of my spare time developing them, and I spent a whole lot of money setting up and maintaining different test environments. And I plan to continue doing so and keeping the core of Set-OutlookSignatures free and open source software.

You are probably an Exchange or client administrator, and as such you are part of the community I want to give something back to.

I do not expect or request thank yous from fellow admins, as our community lives from both giving and taking.

I draw the line where companies, rather than individuals, benefit one-sidedly. The tagline reminds companies that they benefit from open source software and that there is a way to ensure that Set-OutlookSignatures remains open source and is developed further by supporting it financially and at the same time gaining access to even more useful features.

By the way: Companies often make wrong assumptions about free and open source software. Open source software absolutely can contain closed source code. The term "open source" does not automatically imply free usage or even free access to the code. The permission to use software for free does not imply free support.

### Not sure if Set-OutlookSignatures is the right solution for your company?<!-- omit in toc -->
The core of Set-OutlookSignatures is available free of charge as open-source software and can be used for as long and for as many mailboxes as your company wants.<br>All documentation is publicly available, and you can get free community support at GitHub or get first-class fee-based support, training, workshops and more from [ExplicIT Consulting](https://explicitconsulting.at/open-source/set-outlooksignatures/).

For a small annual fee per mailbox, the [Benefactor Circle add-on](https://github.com/Set-OutlookSignatures/Set-OutlookSignatures/blob/main/docs/Benefactor%20Circle.md) offers a whole bunch of additional features.<br>All documentation is publicly available, and the free 14-day trial version allows companies to test all additional features at no cost.

## 14.36 Why is the out-of-office assistant not activated automatically?<!-- omit in toc -->
OOF templates are only applied if the out-of-office assistant is currently disabled. If it is currently active or scheduled to be automatically activated in the future, OOF templates are not applied.

The user has to activate the out-of-office assistant manually. Through the use of templates, the user only has to make no to only little changes to the text (such as the return date, possibly).

The reason for this is that there is no generic way to detect when a user will be absent, when he will come back and how much in advance the out-of-office assistant should be activated. While you may have defined clear rules in your company and your users fully adhere to these rules, the rules and their usage may be handled completely different in other companies.

## 14.37 When should I refer on-prem groups and when Entra ID groups?<!-- omit in toc -->
The following is valid for using groups in INI files as well as for Benefactor Circle licensing groups:
- When using the '-GraphOnly true' parameter, prefer Entra ID groups ('EntraID <…>'). You may also use on-prem groups ('<DNS or NetBIOS name of AD domain> <…>') as long as they are synchronized to Entra ID.
- In hybrid environments without using the '-GraphOnly true' parameter, prefer on-prem groups ('<DNS or NetBIOS name of AD domain> <…>') synchronized to Entra ID. Pure entra ID groups ('EntraID <…>') only make sense when all mailboxes covered by Set-OutlookSignatures are hosted in Exchange Online.
- Pure on-prem environments: You can only use on-prem groups ('<DNS or NetBIOS name of AD domain> <…>'). When moving to a hybrid environment, you do not need to adapt the configuration as long as you synchronize your on-prem groups to Entra ID.

## 14.38 Why are signatures and out-of-office replies recreated even when their content has not changed?<!-- omit in toc -->
Signatures and out-of-office replies are deliberately recreated each time Set-OutlookSignatures runs. The effort required to check whether anything has changed since the last run would be greater than actually creating them new.

Changes affecting signatures and out-of-office replies may have been made on the user's client, in the users's mailbox, in Entra ID or Active Directory, in template files, and in configuration files.

The only reliable way to detect changes in an environment where things can be modified in so many places would be to calculate what the new signatures would look like with current values and then compare these with the existing ones - but if you already have the new signatures and out-of-office replies anyway, overwriting the existing ones is faster than comparing them.

## 14.39 Empty lines contain an underlined space character<!-- omit in toc -->
Outlook, especially the Web version, sometimes does not show an empty line but a line with a single underlined space character:

```
<a hyperlink>
_
<some text>
```

instead of

```
<a hyperlink>

<some text>
```

This usually happens when the text before the empty line ends with a hyperlink.

To avoid this, add a non-breaking space character to the empty line in your template and to the end of the preceeding line:
- Word: Insert, Symbol, More Symbols, Special Character, Nonbreaking Space
- HTML: '`&nbsp;`'

This trick also helps when text separating two hyperlinks is underlined:

```
<a hyperlink>_<another hyperlink>
```

instead of

```
<a hyperlink> <another hyperlink>
```

The root cause is unknown, but it seems to be related to the HTML parser of the office.js framework, which is used by Outlook for all platforms to perform specific tasks.

## 14.40 What about Microsoft turning off Exchange Web Services for Exchange Online?<!-- omit in toc -->
Microsoft will turn of Exchange Web Services (EWS) for Exchange Online. This is announced to happen in October 2026. This only affects Exchange in the cloud, not Exchange hosted on premises.

Set-OutlookSignatures, the Benefactor Circle add-on and the Outlook add-in are prepared for this since the end of 2023, when Microsoft made their first announcement about this.

Unfortunately, the Graph API does not yet offer the same feature set as EWS. This affects the following features for mailboxes hosted in Exchange Online (and only in Exchange Online):
- Setting the classic Outlook Web signature<br>The classic Outlook Web signature can only be seen when using Outlook Web on a browser in mobile view. This only affects a vanishingly small number of users, the trend is downwards, and it is not yet clear if Microsoft will ever bring this feature to the Graph API.<br>Roaming signatures are not affected. Exchange on-prem is not affected.
- Getting additional mailboxes from Outlook Web<br>This affects all editions of Outlook which are not the Classic Outlook for Windows - in other words: New Outlook for Windows, any Outlook for macOS, and running Set-OutlookSignatures on Linux.<br>It is very likely that Microsoft will update the Graph API to support this feature. The timeline is unknown.<br>Detecting automapped mailboxes is not affected. Exchange on-prem is not affected.


## 14.41 Roaming signatures in Classic Outlook for Windows look different<!-- omit in toc -->
When letting Classic Outlook for Windows sync roaming signatures itself, you very likely run into multiple problems.

The most disturbing one is that the encoding of characters within the signatures is wrong.

Here is how you can test if the current patch level of Classic Outlook for Windows is affected:
1. Ensure that the system codepage of your Windows client is not set to UTF-8, but to a local codepage as Windows does per default (such as Windows-1252 in Western Europe). Setting the codepage to UTF-8 is possible, but it is still an optional beta feature. 
2. Ensure that Classic Outlook for Windows is configured to use roaming signatures.
3. Create a new signature in Outlook Web (not in any other Outlook) with the following content:

    ```
    Test signature with UTF-8 characters
    ä (a with umlaut)
    ö (o with umlaut)
    ü (u with umlaut)
    𝄞 (musical symbol G clef)
    😃 (grinning face with big eyes)
    😞 (disappointed face)
    🧩 (puzzle piece)
    ⭐ (star)
    ```

4. Wait until Classic Outlook for Windows has downloaded the signature locally.
5. Add the freshly downloaded signature to a new email in Classic Outlook for Windows or open the downloaded file directly in a browser.
6. You will notice that the UTF-8 characters are not displayed correctly.

This is because Classic Outlook for Windows performs a wrong codepage conversion. Microsoft knows about this error since roaming signatures have been introduced multiple years ago, but it has not yet been fixed.

Some other problems with the internal roaming signature sync mechanism of classic Outlook for Windows are that you cannot reliably trigger the sync and that it can take hours until a changed or new signature is downloaded.

The sync mechanism included in the Benefactor Circle add-on does not have these problems.

This can be a problem, especially when using Set-OutlookSignatures in SimulateAndDeploy mode. If you really cannot switch to running Set-OutlookSignatures on the clients of your users, the Outlook add-in that comes with the Benefactor Circle license may be an alternative to the erronous internal roaming signature sync mechanism of Classic Outlook for Windows.
