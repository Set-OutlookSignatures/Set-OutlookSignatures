## <a href="https://github.com/GruberMarkus/Set-OutlookSignatures/releases/tag/v3.2.1" target="_blank">v3.2.1</a> - 2022-08-04
_Attention cloud mailbox users: Microsoft will make roaming signatures available in late 2022. See 'What about the roaming signatures feature announced by Microsoft?' in README for details and recommended preparation steps._
### Added
- New FAQ: Why does the text color of my signature change sometimes?
### Fixed
- The permission check no longer takes more time than necessary by showing all allow or deny reasons, only the first match. Denies are only evaluated when an allow match has been found before.
- Template file categorization time no longer grows exponentially with each template appearing multiple times in an ini file
- Handle nested attribute names in graph config file correctly ('onPremisesExtensionAttributes.extensionAttribute1' et al.) (<a href="https://github.com/GruberMarkus/Set-OutlookSignatures/issues/41" target="_blank">#41</a>) (Thanks <a href="https://github.com/dakolta" target="_blank">@dakolta</a>!)
- Handle ini files with only one section correctly (<a href="https://github.com/GruberMarkus/Set-OutlookSignatures/issues/42" target="_blank">#42</a>) (Thanks <a href="https://github.com/dakolta" target="_blank">@dakolta</a>!)
- Include 'state' in list of default replacement variables (<a href="https://github.com/GruberMarkus/Set-OutlookSignatures/issues/44" target="_blank">#44</a>) (Thanks <a href="https://github.com/dakolta" target="_blank">@dakolta</a>!)
- The code detecting Outlook and Word registry version, file version and bitness has been corrected

## <a href="https://github.com/GruberMarkus/Set-OutlookSignatures/releases/tag/v3.2.0" target="_blank">v3.2.0</a> - 2022-07-19
_Attention cloud mailbox users: Microsoft will make roaming signatures available in late 2022. See 'What about the roaming signatures feature announced by Microsoft?' in README for details and recommended preparation steps._
### Added
- Workaround for Word ignoring manual line breaks ('`` `n ``') and paragraph marks ('`` `r`n ``') in replacement variables when converting a template to a signature in RTF format (signatures in HTM and TXT formats are not affected).
- Sample script '`Test-ADTrust.ps1`' to test the connection to all Domain Controllers and Global Catalog server of a trusted domain

## <a href="https://github.com/GruberMarkus/Set-OutlookSignatures/releases/tag/v3.1.0" target="_blank">v3.1.0</a> - 2022-06-26
_Attention cloud mailbox users: Microsoft will make roaming signatures available in late 2022. See 'What about the roaming signatures feature announced by Microsoft?' in README for details and recommended preparation steps._
### Changed
- Each template reference in an INI file is now considered individually, not just the last entry. See 'How to work with ini files' in README for a usecase example.
- Additional output is now fully available in the verbose stream, and no longer scattered around the debug and the verbose streams
- Rewrite FAQ "Why is dynamic group membership not considered on premises?" to reflect recent substantial changes in Microsoft Graph, which make Set-OutlookSignatures automatically support dynamic groups in the cloud. See the FAQ in README for more details and the reason why dynamic groups are not supported on premises.
- Extend FAQ "How to avoid blank lines when replacement variables return an empty string?" with new examples and sample code that automatically differentiates between DOCX and HTM templates
- Optimized format of 'hashes.txt'
### Fixed
- Convert WebDAV paths to a PowerShell compatible format before accessing them. (<a href="https://github.com/GruberMarkus/Set-OutlookSignatures/discussions/38" target="_blank">#38</a>) (Thanks <a href="https://github.com/Johan-Claesson" target="_blank">@Johan-Claesson</a>!)

## <a href="https://github.com/GruberMarkus/Set-OutlookSignatures/releases/tag/v3.0.0" target="_blank">v3.0.0</a> - 2022-04-20
_This major release brings several changes which can make it incompatible with previous versions. Pay special attention to the changes marked '**Breaking:**' to find out if your environment is affected and what to do._
### Added
- New FAQ: How can I get more script output for troubleshooting?
### Changed
- **Breaking:** All input files of type .htm, .ini and .ps1 are now expected to be UTF8 encoded.  
If you copied and/or modified the sample files delivered with earlier versions of Set-OutlookSignatures, no changes should be necessary as these were delivered in UTF8 already. Please check the encoding anyway.
- The following data of the currently processed mailbox is no longer displayed in the standard output stream but in the verbose output stream: 
  - List of group membership security identifiers (SIDs)
  - List of SMTP addresses
  - Final data of replacement variables
- Update documentation to make clear that 'NetBiosDomain' and 'Example' are just examples which need to be replaced with actual NetBIOS domain names, but 'AzureAD' is not an example
### Removed
- **Breaking:** File name based tags are no longer supported. Use ini files instead.  
This change has been announced with the release of v2.5.0 on 2022-01-14.
- **Breaking:** Parameter AdditionalSignaturePathFolder is no longer supported. Just append the folder to the AdditionalSignaturePath parameter.
- All sample files with tags based on file names have been removed

## <a href="https://github.com/GruberMarkus/Set-OutlookSignatures/releases/tag/v2.5.2" target="_blank">v2.5.2</a> - 2022-02-09
### Fixed
- Use another Windows API to get the Active Directory object of the logged in user. This API also works when 'CN=Computers,DC=[...]' does not exist or the logged in user does not have read access to it. (Thanks <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariandanisek/" target="_blank">Marián Daníšek</a>!)
- Correct handle objectSid and SidHistory returned from Graph. The format is no longer a byte array as from on-prem Active Directory, but a list of clear text strings ('S-1-[...]').
- Validate SimulateUser and SimulateMailboxes input

- Consider sIDHistory in searches across trusts and when comparing msExchMasterAccountSid, which adds support for scenarios in which a mailbox or a linked account has been migrated between Active Directory domains/forests

- Show which tags lead to a classification as time based, common, group based or e-mail address specific template
- New FAQ: Why is membership in dynamic distribution groups and dynamic security groups not considered?
- New FAQ: Why is no admin or user GUI available?
### Fixed
- Don't throw an error when UseHtmTemplates is set to true and OOFIniFile is used, but there is no \*.htm file in OOFTemplatePath
- Correct mapping of Graph businessPhones attribute, so the replacement variable `$CURRENT[...]TELEPHONE$` is populated (<a href="https://github.com/GruberMarkus/Set-OutlookSignatures/issues/26" target="_blank">#26</a>)  (Thanks <a href="https://github.com/vitorpereira" target="_blank">@vitorpereira</a>!)
- Fix Outlook 2013 registry key handling and temporary folder handling in environments without Outlook or Outlook profile (<a href="https://github.com/GruberMarkus/Set-OutlookSignatures/issues/27" target="_blank">#27</a>)  (Thanks <a href="https://github.com/Imaginos" target="_blank">@Imaginos</a>!)
### Changed
- Cache group SIDs across all types of templates to reduce network load and increase script speed

### Fixed
- Do not ignore remote mailboxes when searching mailboxes in Active Directory (Thanks <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lwhdk/" target="_blank">Lars Würtz Hammer</a>!)
- Correctly handle hybrid scenarios with basic auth disabled in the cloud (Thanks <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lwhdk/" target="_blank">Lars Würtz Hammer</a>!)
- Correctly handle time based tags, so they are not checked twice (the first check is positive, the second one returns 'unknown tag')
